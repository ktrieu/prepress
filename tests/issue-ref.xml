<article><title>Fight Breaks Out on Roof of Davis Centre</title>
<content><strong>Waterloo, ON</strong> — Last Tuesday, two unidentified individuals were observed to be engaged in a standoff atop the Davis Centre that eventually came to blows. Witnesses reported they didn’t notice anything unusual until a loud, disembodied voice shouted “GO!”, at which time they looked around and noticed two figures on the roof of the nearby DC atrium. It is uncertain how the fighters gained access to the roof, which is normally off limits to all non-maintenance personnel. One witness claims to have seen the two individuals jump out of pipes, but a search of the roof failed to locate any locations where a pipe large enough for a human to fit inside would have been visible from the ground.
According to observers, the smaller of the two fighters (here identified as “One” pending police identification) jumped at the second (here “Two”) while attempting to throw a punch, but Two rolled out of the way and followed up with a devastating uppercut to One’s shoulder. One was launched up into the air; Two jumped, attempting to follow up, but One pulled out a red shield and deflected Two’s attack. Both fighters were unable to move until they touched the ground. Simultaneously, they dove for an over-sized hammer that had appeared nearby. One got there just in time and began swinging the hammer at Two, who had realized it was too late to turn around. One connected with the hammer; Two was launched off the roof and exploded in a burst of red light, but One continued to swing the hammer, somehow unable to let go.
By some miracle, Two appeared again a few seconds later, on a metal platform suspended above the roof. Two growled with rage and pulled out a small firearm, taking several pot-shots at One while One rushed forward yet again. Although every shot hit its mark, One was undeterred and Two managed to get out of the way just in time as One leapt forward with another jumping attack. This would prove to be a tactical failure for One, who was sent flying off of the roof with the force of the jump and could not control their fall or recover. A puff of smoke was all that was left of One at this point.
However, One was back atop the roof and back in the fight. The combatants traded blows for a few minutes, neither managing to land a decisive hit but both visibly sweating and steaming after a string of several solid hits and near misses. At this point, several witnesses reported some kind of glowing weather balloon or inflatable ball had been caught by the wind and was blown toward the rooftop. The fighters seemed to take immense interest in this orb and broke off the attack, each attempting to out-race the other and get to the ball first. One bull-rushed toward the orb and was making good headway, but Two, in a desperation move, lit himself on fire and used the force of the exploding air to propel himself toward the orb. Two made first contact but was unable to break the ball; One took a chance and jumped off of Two’s head but could not get enough vertical distance to reach the balloon. Two, remembering his firearm, shot the ball until it broke, at which point a large tank fell from the sky and crushed One, blasting him into the stratosphere.
After the fight, One could not be located for comment; however, Two, as the winner of the fight, proudly came down from the roof to speak to the gathered crowd. He said the DC roof was chosen because it was, according to him, “a good stage… no gimmicks”, but was upset at the appearance of the hammer during the fight.
“I thought we agreed, ‘No items, me only, DC rooftop’, but <i>someone</i> cares more about the fun than the glory.”
He insisted that the combat was “just something they did to blow off steam” and that neither competitor was seriously injured, despite having visibly lost their lives on several occasions.
Witnesses agree that everyone involved had a smashing good time.

<article><title>IST to Implement RFC 1149-Compliant Wireless Network</title>
<content><strong>Waterloo, ON</strong> — Coming on the heels of the recent announcement of the demise of the <em>uw-unsecured</em> wireless access network, the University of Waterloo’s Information Systems and Technology group has followed up with a surprising press release. The plan is to roll out a campus area network to replace <em>uw-unsecured</em> over the next few months. In an unprecedented move, the network equipment they have chosen is compliant with RFC 1149, a proposed Internet standard that describes a protocol for “…the Transmission of IP Datagrams on Avian Carriers”.
Representatives from IST have said that RFC 1149 networks do not suffer from the connection difficulties that plague <em>eduroam</em>, such as loss of signal and weak connections.
“The vendor has recommended that users keep a supply of seeds and small grains near their wireless device to ensure the highest possible signal strength. Avian carriers can be finicky, but this is a proven, field-tested solution.”
A campus-wide recycling initiative will be put in place to recycle the “scroll[s] of paper” used as the packet transmission medium by RFC 1149.
The main obstacle to deployment of this network, not surprisingly, is the presence of geese.
“We expect to see a significant number of dropped packets and lost carriers in the spring, around nesting season,” says one IST network manager. “We’re going to roll out some extensions to the base protocol to compensate for this. No one has implemented the Quality-of-Service extensions in RFC 2549 yet, but that’s never stopped us before. If we define a prioritized pecking order for our carriers, we can ensure that essential services are preserved during periods of disruption.”
The cost to the University is expected to be recovered in the long term, as the carriers work for birdseed and self-regenerate. Additional worm detection and elimination would be provided to users of the service at no extra cost.
Members of a competing firm putting together a proposal for a campus-wide deployment of an RFC 6921 (“Design Considerations for Faster-than-Light Communication”) network were unavailable for comment at time of printing.

<article><title>The C&amp;Ds of UW</title>
<content>Many people here at UW go to Tim Horton’s for their morning coffee, as they provide fast double doubles on the go. However, for those of us who prefer cheaper coffee, or just don’t like Tim Hortons, there are faculty-run C&amp;Ds. I’ve been to all of them, except for the Environment C&amp;D. They have something called fair trade coffee, which is higher in price compared to the coffee in the other C&amp;Ds.
In my opinion, the Math C&amp;D is the spaciest, with more selection than the other C&amp;Ds, and each cup of coffee is about 75 cents. The Engineering C&amp;D has a similar selection to Math’s, but the space inside the C&amp;D is cramped. The coffee is cheap if you bring in your own mug (about 60 cents). The Science C&amp;D is the most relaxed one, and you can even bring backpacks into it! The price of each cup is the same as Engineering, but there is a limited variety of coffees and snacks.
Math and Engineering C&amp;Ds have different types of flavoured coffee, hot chocolate/cappuccinos (both pricier than coffee), a selection of donuts, and other foods. Neither of the C&amp;Ds allow for backpacks in the store, nor accept Watcard — only the Math C&amp;D accepts debit cards. The Math and Engineering C&amp;Ds are also the only ones that have paid employees.
The Math C&amp;D is located on the 3rd floor of MC, Engineering on the first floor of CPH (on the south side), and Science is close to the Bio building entrance under the overpass to the ESC building.
This is only a tidbit of the C&amp;Ds of the university; I recommend exploring each one and discovering your favourite one. Enjoy your coffee and donuts!

<article><title>A statistically proven method to write a winning article using a data-driven model based on previous winning articles</title>
<content><strong>Abstract</strong>
The title <em>Article of the Issue</em> is a long sought after status quo that is a dream achievement for many hungry starved uWaterloo mathNEWS contributors. By developing a statistical approach to analyzing past submissions, this article shows how to assemble a winning article using a computational approach in Python of the most commonly used phrases and words, thereby allowing other writers to use a data-driven approach to having a higher probability of achieving <em>Article Of The Issue</em>.
<ol><li><strong>Methods</strong></li></ol>
The current and past term articles of the issue were selected by copying and pasting into a plain-text document from the posted PDF files found online on http://mathnews.uwaterloo.ca. This data was then parsed in Python, stripping out newlines and additional spaces. Twogram and threegram (Where an <em>ngram </em>is <em>n</em> words beside each other) were gathered, and the top fifty of each dataset were selected. By selecting out the most frequently occurring twogram and threegram, sentences could then be constructed to form a mostly cohesive sentence made from literary gold in the eyes of the MathNEWS editors.
<strong>2. Results</strong>
The existence of of a god. Some of the number of mines must be a University of Waterloo. The Cosmological Argument game-piece designs that the universe of information can be the most miracle that midiLength = a god. For some game would be nothing, Surely the gods must have a coming to campus at time t=0.
Surely the gods must be nothing.
<strong>3. Discussion</strong>
<em>3.1 Sources of error</em>
While the source of data was a digital form (PDFs), there are inherent issues with copying a formatted document into unformatted text. Small special characters such as non-breakable space characters cause MathNEWS to show up as a common ngram Math NEWS. Some words that are not on multiple lines showed up on multiple lines, which could cause some ngrams to be higher on the list. For an improved revision of this computational model’s input, as well as output, the raw unformatted text from the drafts should be considered as an improved input.
<em>3.2 Next steps</em>
With a larger input dataset and more funding and time for the researchers involved in this study, markov chains could be considered to further automate this process of generating quality content. However, due to time constraints, only the past term and the current term could be fetched and placed into the input dataset, resulting in a small set of ngrams, not enough for a good markov training dataset.

<article><title>ed(1) is Turing-Complete</title>
<content>Yet another tool has been added to our list of accidentally Turing-complete things. This time, it’s the venerable line editor, ed(1) (ed is the standard text editor).
Ed, the original Unix text editor, was written in the 1970s, back when teleprinters were the computer’s main interface. Unlike virtually all modern editors, it’s what’s called a line editor: you manipulate the file as lines through a command line interface instead of displaying a live copy of the text as you edit it. It enjoys only niche use today, but its influence has spread to many utilities, including sed, grep, vi and even perl.
If you aren’t familiar with ed and you decide to try it out yourself, your first session will probably look like this:<sup><sup>1</sup></sup>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>$ ed
help
?
h
Invalid command suffix
?
?
^C
?
exit
?
quit
?
^Z
$ killall ed
$ vi</code></pre>
</blockquote>
It isn’t a terribly friendly editor, but it was good enough to write Unix in. If you know your vi/vim commands, you’re already halfway there.
Despite its seemingly simple command set, ed was proven to be Turing-complete by implementing Rule 110, an elementary cellular automaton similar to Conway’s Game of Life that was shown to be capable of universal computation. This is the same device that was used to show that HTML+CSS3 is Turing-complete.
Here’s the script, licensed under the MIT by tPenguinLTG:<sup><sup>2</sup></sup>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>$a
.
-t.
.g/^\(.\).*\(.\)$/s//\2&amp;\1/
.g/^.$/s//&amp;&amp;&amp;/
s/./&amp;\
/g
d
?^$?+,$-2g/^/+,+2t.\
-2,.j\
s/111/0/\
s/110/1/\
s/101/1/\
s/100/0/\
s/011/1/\
s/010/1/\
s/001/1/\
s/000/0/
$-,$d
?^$?,$jp
w
!exec ed '%' &lt; '%'
q
# DATA
00000000000000000000000000000100
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
You’d run this by invoking <code>ed</code> on it to edit, as well as passing it in as input:
<blockquote>
<pre><code>$ ed rule110.ed &lt; rule110.ed</code></pre>
</blockquote>
It doesn’t terminate by itself, so you’ll have to manually kill it. The result of the simulation is written to the end of the file.
Long story short, the script implements each step of Rule 110 using a bunch of substitutions, and it achieves recursion by shelling out to call itself. Even better, the script passes data between recursive calls by modifying itself. Cheating? Maybe, but it works. A detailed walkthrough of the script and links to the GitHub repo can be found in tPenguinLTG’s blog post.<sup><sup>2</sup></sup>
As Reddit user meltingdiamond put it, “The most impressive part of this is somehow getting ed to do anything at all”.

<article><title>I&#39;m writing an article about a proof assistant</title>
<content><strong>Alternative title: Only 109* people will understand this article but I want pizza</strong>
First year math students typically take three mandatory courses in their 1A term: MATH135, MATH137, and CS115/135. Each of these courses runs an advanced section, MATH145, MATH147, and CS145 respectively. Certain mathematically gifted students elect to take these courses. A number of other students, for whatever strange reason, also elect to take these courses despite their lack of extraordinary math ability. I fall into the latter category, and now find myself one of two situations at all times — I am either:
<ol><li>Working on the MATH145 assignment, or</li>
<li>Thinking about the MATH145 assignment.</li></ol>
This year, there are actually two sections for each of the advanced math courses, taught by two different profs. Professor David Jao, who teaches one of the MATH145 sections, is using a software tool called Coq (pronounced Coke) to teach his class this year. Coq allows the formal expression of mathematical definitions and theorems and the proofs for those theorems, and, relevant to MATH145, forces its users to write extremely rigorous proofs. The assignments for this section of MATH145 heavily involve the use of Coq, and since, as previously stated, I am always either working on the assignment or thinking about the assignment, it has affected the scope of what I think about day to day.
So of course, in writing this article, I really could not come up with anything better to write about. Or anything else to write about at all, for that matter. Sorry.
Coq is a software tool used to for a variety of purposes including the certification of properties of programming languages, the formalization of mathematics, and teaching. The development of Coq began in 1984, supported by a whole slew of French universities and research institutes, and its initial release was in May of 1989. Today, it is used for many purposes and specifically as an educational tool in math and computer science. It is used internationally in many countries including France, Sweden, the US, Canada, Poland, the Netherlands, and South Korea.
The word <em>“coq”</em> means rooster in French. Apparently it is common practice to name research tools after animals in France. Coq was actually initially named CoC, after Calculus of Constructions, the typed** programming language that was implemented by Coq in its earliest days. In 1991, the name was changed from CoC to Coq, reflecting the new implementation of the extended Calculus of Inductive Constructions (also a typed programming language). The name Coq is also a reference to Thierry Coquand, a professor of computer science in Sweden who helped develop Calculus of Constructions and Calculus of Inductive Constructions.
There is quite an active online community surrounding Coq. Coq has a mailing list (though I haven’t quite figured out what exactly is sent through that mailing list — perhaps now is the time to engage in some investigative journalism), an active subreddit (r/Coq), and is frequently discussed on Stack Overflow and Stack Exchange. Coq is also on Github where users report bugs and help fix issues, and the repository has over 100 contributors.
At this point I think I’ve exhausted all the information I could find and understand about Coq, which means it’s time for me to stop writing about Coq and return to actually using it to (hopefully) finish this assignment. I hope this article was educational to those wondering why some of the MATH145 kids are programming, and entertaining for those of us suffering*** through it.

*  This number will most definitely be inaccurate when this issue is published.
** If you were actually interested: typed here does not mean typing on a computer. Typed refers to type theory, a  mathematically defined system in which every term has a type and operations are restricted to terms of a certain type.
*** I kid! I love Coq, and I love this class. I am most definitely suffering though (help me).</content></article>
<article><title>What if all humans pissed at the same time and place?</title>
<content><em>Because Randall Munroe hasn’t answered this question yet.</em>
First off, I don’t know what kind of scenario would require all of humanity taking a piss at the same time. Aside from the minutes before a species-wide road trip, there’s really no reason to consider this ever happening. Really, there isn’t.
But this is <em>math</em><strong>NEWS</strong>, so we’ll consider it anyways.
There’s a lot of Google results about “what if all humans pissed at once” <sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>. Most of them come to the same boring conclusion: nothing would happen, because sewers are a thing. Furthermore, outside of “what if everyone pissed into the ocean”, I have been unable to find any articles on the effects of all of humankind simultaneously excreting the contents of their bladders in the same place. But because this is a news article, dramatization and hyperbole is necessary to answer the given question — such resources won’t do. Instead, let’s get our hands dirty, and dive into what would happen if the human population actually ended up in the same geographical location with full bladders, and simultaneously went to the toilet.
The first issue we’re faced with is something that Randall Munroe, who is the actual creator of what if? (and thus the inspiration behind the entire article), managed to solve: how much space would you need to fit the entire population of the Earth? We can safely assume that we are looking at only the living portion of all humans, and not the deceased nor undead<sup>3</sup>. A crowd of all 7.7 billion living humans would be be slightly bigger than Rhode Island<sup>4</sup>, or 55.5% of PEI<sup>5</sup>. Not bad. In fact, just to make everyone a bit more comfortable, we’ll arrange for everyone to be in PEI instead of Rhode Island, and centralize the crowd around Glen Valley, its highest point. A lot roomier, and the food is probably better! There’s probably even room for some privacy guards.
For the actual pissing portion, an examination of what kind of biblically-proportioned flood might result would be useful. The closest internet source I could find regarding this was a surprisingly accurate Yahoo Answers post from eight years ago<sup>6</sup>, which states that the combined volume of urine would be 2,070,000,000 litres, or enough to fill only 828 Olympic-sized swimming pools. Unfortunately, the estimated bladder size in the answer is for normal capacity, not maximum, so for the purposes of this article it completely misses the mark. Add in the hundreds of millions of people that have been born between 2010 and 2018, and it becomes clear that this is a piss-poor estimate.
So, back to basics. Depending on which textbook you trust, a healthy adult human bladder has a maximum capacity of anywhere from 470 millilitres to a full litre<sup>7</sup><sup>8</sup>. Of course, not everyone’s bladder will be big enough to hold a full saucepan’s worth of urine, so we’ll assume an average maximum of 700 mL. Maybe a bit on the liberal side considering the child populace, but it sounds about right. We can now calculate the new combined volume:
<link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/What_if_al_08908bb75aeb497ba9c97c80b4f515a76bbe9350.pdf"></link>
That’s equivalent to 2156 Olympic-sized <del>swimming</del> pissing pools. Determining how long it would take to swim a lap in each pisscine is left as a mental exercise to the reader.
Regardless, 5,390,000,000 litres is a crapload of piss to be talking about. In particular, that means supplying at least 5,390,000,000 litres of water to everyone right before the pee-scheduled urination time. Aside from the logistical nightmare of finding a place to store that much water, there’s also the slightly smaller issue of where to procure five billion litres of freshwater. You’re looking at shipping over New York City’s daily water consumption<sup>9</sup> to a tiny island in Atlantic Canada, and that’s just the lower bound. If it’s a particularly hot day, that number is going way up. And if our supply chain is inefficient, people could be left holding their pee in for hours, resulting in possibly the loudest chorus of “Can I use the toilet?” ever heard. It actually turns out that water supply is the least of our problems, but we’ll get to that part later.
Now that we’ve set up everyone, we can commence our scenario<sup>10</sup>. At the signal, 7.7 billion humans begin relieving themselves. Spread out, they don’t do <em>too</em> much damage. The human urinary flow rate is small enough that the loose, loamy soil absorbs most of the initial onslaught before saturating and turning into mud. PEI also produces more potatoes than it produces asparagus, so the initial pee smell isn’t too bad for one. Geographically, where elevation is higher, damage is limited to a few new creeks and washouts. The most damage would be seen close to the coast and major watersheds, where elevation is lowest. There, streams of urine combine to erode the soil to the bedrock, while also washing away a few thousand participants. Vast, bare wastelands of piss-contaminated mud replace towns and villages, and the few structures that do remain standing are completely inaccessible by land. Environmentally, watersheds that aren’t already destroyed by the mudflows become heavily eutrophic, and within a few days the resulting algae blooms kill off all aquatic animal life, resulting in a stench that overhangs the island for days. But as always, it could be worse.
Now, I could call it a day here. It’s pretty darn late, I pulled an all-nighter yesterday, and another one today isn’t going to do me any good.  Except we still haven’t <em>quite</em> answered the given question. After all, ambiguity begets questions like “what if everyone just peed on the same spot of earth at the same time? How would that happen?”
Answer: If you thought our problems before were bad, just wait.
In order to get 7.7 billion people to aim at the same spot of earth, we need to spread everyone out vertically instead of horizontally. This means building very tall structures, and that’s where we hit our first problem. For optimal efficiency, we make our target circular<sup>11</sup>, and just for simplicity’s sake we’ll assume a circle of radius one metre — small enough to count as a single spot of earth compared to the numbers we’re dealing with, but big enough that hopefully no one will miss. From experience, 14 people can make a circle with radius a bit more than 1 m,  so we’ll be stacking everyone up in levels of 14. Already, this is beginning to look like a stupendously tall structure, so just to lessen the pressure on our poor engineers we’ll stagger the levels so that a new one begins every half-human-height, thus halving the height of our Tower of Piss. The average height of a human is 1.65 metres, so if we order people across levels by height, we get an average of 0.825 metres of spacing between levels. That leads to a height of….drumroll…
<link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/What_if_al_6d248d4960cd9d12b2484295ff28fc3eb8b07f7b.pdf"></link>
In other words, only 1.2 times the distance between the Moon and the Earth. Yep, completely doable.
Erecting such a structure on solid ground would require some serious engineering. Erecting such a structure on PEI, where the underlying bedrock is a “soft red sandstone"<sup>12</sup>, is even harder. You’d have to do some serious load balancing in order to not overload the bedrock, and even then, that sandstone would be very close to failure.
But with the help of some overworked graduate students, we managed to overcome both the engineering issues and the issue of colliding with the Moon. We now have a structure taller than any ever built, so tall that 99.999996% of its occupants would have to wear pressure suits in order to survive<sup>13</sup>. It’s also so tall that we need some sort of urine collection mechanism for the upper storeys, for comfort and so that the stream stays liquid all the way down. A dreadfully expensive cost, but since we already went with the hassle of moving everyone here and actually building this thing, we’ll do it anyways and fund it out of UofT’s budget.
To recap, we’ve erected a giant tower, loaded everyone onto it, and hammered in some expensive equipment to make sure we have a laminar stream of piss coming all the way down. Splashback and misting issues aside, this actually seems feasible. We do have to start the topmost storeys early to make sure that everyone’s piss hits the ground at the same time, but that’s pretty much a non-issue at this point. With that being said, let us commence the operation.
At T-9618s, the top most storey is given the signal to start pissing.
At T-6801s, 50% of the world’s population have relieved themselves.
At T-4809s, 75% of the world’s population have emptied their bladders.
At T-1s, a bit less than 5,390,000,000 litres of urine hangs five metres above the ground. I don’t know what velocity it’s achieved at this point, but it’s definitely towards the right side of the interval [0, I-don’t-even-want-to-think-about-it).
At T-0.5s, the mass of urine sits 1.2 metres above ground. A dark yellow shadow hangs over the land, an ominous warning of what is yet to come.
At T-0.1s, the mass of urine is five centimetres away from touching the soft, loamy soil of Prince Edward Island. It is moving so fast that the air beneath it is being pushed out at supersonic speeds, scouring the ground surface and killing everyone on the first level.  Thankfully, our grad students did their jobs, and despite the enormous force on its structure, the tower stands.
At T-0s, impact occurs.
It is at this point that we take a short, but relevant, diversion. Back in 2013, a group of physicists at Georgia Tech discovered that, on average, mammals urinate for 21 seconds with a standard deviation of 13 seconds<sup>14</sup><sup>15</sup>. As humans are mammals [citation needed], we’ll assume that everyone in our scenario pisses for an average of 34 seconds, since full bladders are involved. With 5,390,000,000 litres of urine being involved, this yields an average flow rate that is a staggering <em>158,529,411.8 litres per second</em>. For those of you keeping track at home, that’s equivalent to over 27 Niagara Falls.
Against 27 Niagara Falls’ worth of water crashing down at God-knows-what-number metres per second, the soil underneath our target doesn’t stand a chance. The stream obliterates the topsoil layer, throwing up a giant geyser of mud and sand and choking everyone on the lower levels. In less than a second, it hits the bedrock. Already at its breaking point, the sandstone catastrophically fails, compromising the foundation and nullifying the efforts of our trusty grad students. Meanwhile, a gigantic debris flow begins snaking its way from the remains of Glen Valley towards the relative calm of the Atlantic Ocean, destroying everything in its path. Within seconds, our tower begins to fall.
453,750 kilometres above the Earth’s surface, in the confines of space, a judder is felt, and the tip of the tower begins to accelerate in the direction of the Moon. Alarmed, the occupants try to escape, but to no avail: as the structure disintegrates, all escape routes are cut off, and with everyone on the lower levels either dead or dying, there’s no one to save them once they hit the ground.
At T+34 s, humanity has finally emptied the collective might of its bladders onto the Earth’s surface. Massive debris flows crisscross the landscape,  and where Glen Valley once stood, there now exists a pit full of piss.  Debris from the initial impact and pieces of the disintegrating tower rain down from above, scarring the newly-exposed bedrock and leaving their mark on what used to be Prince Edward Island.
Meanwhile, the tip of the tower continues to accelerate towards the surface of the Moon, despite the best efforts of its pissed-off inhabitants. When they inevitably meet, it’s at an almost unimaginable impact velocity of 1,023 metres per second. The collision shatters the structure, littering the already pockmarked surface with even more craters, and creating humanity’s first (and only) lunar cemetery. It’s a gruesome end.
But hey, at least everyone got to use the toilet.

<article><title>Why does the head of CECA make so much money when all CECA does is fuck over students?</title>
<content>After CECA fucked up by telling everyone they got a job when they didn’t, Ross Johnston, the executive director of CECA sent out an email to everyone apologizing for the human error (i.e. incompetence) I decided to look up how much money Ross Johnston makes. Turns out he’s on the Sunshine List, which means his salary is publicly available information. Here is his salary for 2011–2018.

Of course, nearly all co-op students believe that CECA is not there to help students (try searching for CECA on /r/uwaterloo), and indeed sometimes stands in the way of students achieving their goals. So, Feridun, what does Ross Johnston do in one year that’s worth $177,472.52? Convince us, the student body, that our tuition and fees are being properly spent.
The purpose of a university is academic progress. While employer relations may be important, why does Ross Johnston make more money than some professors here, when professors actually give students the skills needed to succeed in the workplace? You might (if you aren’t a student) argue that CECA helps students prepare for work through their PD courses. But if you talk to anyone who’s actually gone through the PD courses and has a few co-op terms on their belt, they’ll all tell you the same thing: whatever PD says to do, do the opposite.
It’s time that the University of Waterloo takes a long look at how money is being spent at CECA, and on the co-op system in general.

<article><title>Ranking F 2018 / W 2019 14X professor by their fan bases</title>
<content>Note: this article is not meant to imply that any of these professors are better than any other. It’s simply examining the size and quality of the fan bases of each of the professors. Of the professors in this article I have had, they were all great. Of the ones I haven’t had, I have only heard great things.
<strong>6. Ken Davidson</strong>
Ken Davidson is a wonderful prof who you will learn a lot from, but has nevertheless failed to receive a large fan base, although I do have one friend who says “I connect with Ken on a spiritual level”. As far as we know, Davidson lacks a fan page.
<strong>5. Laurent Marcoux</strong>
Marcoux has learned from Davidson, his PhD advisor, and has taken steps to develop a very large fan base. Everybody who has taken a course with Marcoux loves him. However, his fan base is not as committed as the fan bases of some other professors. As far as we know, Marcoux lacks a fan page.
<strong>4. Ross Willard</strong>
Ross Willard is fantastic. My friend, a 18 year-old girl says she wants to be like Ross Willard when she grows up. Not many old white guys are inspiring enough to make young girls want to be like them. Unfortunately, as far as we know, Willard lacks a fan page. However, his fans do have a nickname: Willard’s Dogs.
<strong>3. David McKinnon</strong>
David McKinnon is loved by his students and stories about him make him sound 50 years younger than he looks. He must be a very energetic guy. He uses ♣ instead of ∎ to finish his proofs, which is pretty cool. McKinnon had a fan page, but unfortunately it seems to have gone offline recently. We ask the CSC to put  his fan page, which was hosted at <a href="http://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/~fbauckho/">csclub.uwaterloo.ca/~fbauckho/</a> back online permanently.
<strong>2. Stephen New</strong>
Stephen New, affectionately known as “snew” and “Pastor Snew” after terrifiED called him that while in a panicked state before his midterm, is widely loved by students. He has an active fan page at <a href="https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jj6yu/">student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jj6yu/</a> which contains beautiful pictures of him. He also organizes math contests and helps students prepare for them.
<strong>1. David Jao</strong>
David Jao, affectionately known as “Daddy Jao” for his paternalistic qualities is widely adored by undergraduate and graduate students alike. His curves are legendary. Ken Davidson is known to have said that he doesn’t know anyone who curves like Professor Jao. Legend has it that Professor Willard was once late to our MATH 146 lecture because he was accosted by Professor Jao (or as Willard says, Professor Jaaaaaaaoooo) in the hallway. Daddy Jao is also famous for the wonderful life advice he gives out on Reddit, Piazza, and in office hours. Daddy Jao has an active fan page at <a href="https://daddyjao.com/">daddyjao.com</a> which is also mirrored at <a href="https://daddyjao.gitlab.io/">daddyjao.gitlab.io/</a> in case the .com domain ever expires.

<article><title>Recursion&#39;s Infinity</title>
<content><em>When I posted my first novel excerpt, I wanted to title it “The First N Words of the Story (on which) I’m working (on)” to make a funny grammar joke. The editors did not think this was a good idea and changed it. To jokingly spite them, I wanted to, but didn’t, title my next novel excerpt “The (Next (N (Words (of (the (Story (I’m (Working (On))))))))))”. To my surprise, I was having trouble parsing this title in my head. Of course, I knew what it meant, but as I read through it slowly, I just couldn’t keep track of the parenthetical levels. The what? The next. The next what? The next N. The next N what? The next N Words. The next N words what? Wait, where was I again?</em>

We all know these errors occur when a recursive function doesn’t terminate in time (and we know it’s because recursive function calls continually eat up stack space (at least until the program runs out of memory (which is the risk of writing recursive functions (even if they’re tail-recursive)))). A computer doesn’t have infinite memory, but recursion is the infinite (the never-ending). A recursive function is a hungry, insatiable beast (it devours memory, forever, without stopping (at least not until we pacify it with an exit condition)).
Make a Google search for the word “recursion” and you’ll get this tongue-in-cheek response:
<pre><code>Did you mean: recursion.</code></pre>
You can click on this link (but it only takes you back to this very page (where you can click on it again and again (initiating another recursive program capable of running forever (at least until it hits the exit condition (you get bored) or runs out of memory (you fall asleep))))).
But recursion is not unique to computer science or mathematics (it’s also often seen in art (with pictures and paintings of people holding pictures of themselves (this is called the Droste effect and I’m sure you’ve seen it (but if you haven’t, look at The Laughing Cow next time you go grocery shopping)) and Matroyshka Dolls (nesting dolls that contain smaller versions of themselves (with the smaller dolls being younger than the larger ones)) and infinity mirrors (two mirrors facing each other (which uses infinite reflection to create the illusion of a large landscape populated with infinite copies of some people or objects (placed between the two mirrors)))). Even before the notion of computers, we’ve been infatuated with this special kind of the infinite.
It is unlike the infinity that looks outwards (like when you stare up at the night sky (and wonder how many stars there are (and how many of them are larger than the sun (and just how big is the universe, really?))) and spills and spreads, permeating everywhere, distinguishable nowhere, and demands answers from that mind-boggling vastness, busyness of itself (like the Fermi paradox (which relies on statistical inevitabilities (based on this infinity that promises us unending combinations of chemical soup))). Recursion’s infinity is self-similar (it looks inwards (curling and folding in on itself (containing itself))). When I think of the infinity of largeness (of unboundedness (of the everything)), it shadows me. But I could hold the infinity of recursion in just one hand. See:
<link alt="Image result for apollonian gasket" class="irc_mi" height="220" href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/img/Recursion_220px-ApollonianGasket-15_32_32_33.svg.png" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/ApollonianGasket-15_32_32_33.svg/220px-ApollonianGasket-15_32_32_33.svg.png" width="220"/>
That infinity of everything is fearsome because it is the unknown. Comparatively, recursion’s infinity is seemingly innocuous (it is infinite in a rather familiar sense, after all (since every part of it is already known from the beginning)). It is easy to dismiss. But it is very much an infinity as any other kind, and just as dangerous. Forget the exit condition in your recursive function and the overlooked monster rears its head again, threatening to escape beyond your computer (only stopping because you only have a finite amount of stack space). Its ugly power is in ignorance (because it does not know any better (and so it does not know when to stop (every iteration looks like the previous (so there’s nothing to do but keep going (and going (and going)))))).
Let’s go back to Google and that recursive link (which transformed into a recursive program with the addition of you (whose exit condition was tedium (and the program would run out of memory upon your death (this means that the program could potentially run for 80 years (on American average))))). Because this is an extended metaphor, I’m also going back to the proposed title of my novel excerpt, which looked like a bunch of nested S-expressions (and just look at these parentheticals that I’m using as rhetoric (doesn’t it just look like some cute little Racket code? (and that one was a predicate))). Writing is hard because I keep going on these tangents (and that’s just how we think (every thought keeps leading to another (in a way alike to these parentheticals))). Parsing that title was so hard because I couldn’t keep track of the previous layers (and likewise, forming a coherent argument is pretty hard because I can’t keep track of my train of thought).
Speaking of Racket, here’s our favourite recursive function:
<pre><code>(<mathnews--code-strong>define</mathnews--code-strong> (factorial n)
  (<mathnews--code-strong>if</mathnews--code-strong> (= n 0)
      1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))))</code></pre>
When DrRacket is at <code>(factorial 3)</code> it cannot tell if that was the beginning of the recursive chain, or if it’s part of another call to the function, say <code>(factorial 6)</code>. If I let my mind wander, I start going down parentheticals again (and this is often called a thought spiral (but I would say it’s more like a dense S-expression of thoughts (nested like the DrRacket stepper trying to evaluate a naive Fibonacci function (and also like the DrRacket stepper, I never know which thoughts (if any) preceded this one)))). All I know is that this thought leads to that one (and so I should probably keep going there (I see no reason to stop)). I could keep going until I ran out of memory and died (but realistically, sleep is a sufficient way of artificially limiting stack space).
My favourite thing to look at is the sky. I love how deep it is. I love how I feel like I’m falling towards it when I look up. The sky is limitless, it is that infinity again, the one that terrifies and inspires us with possibilities. But these days I am always looking inwards at this other infinity, the one that curls and twists up inside of me, all inside a conveniently and deceivingly small space, and I never know it.</content></article>
<article><title>Gratitude</title>
<content><h1> <span style="font-weight: 400;">What is Gratitude?</span></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Google says, “Gratitude, thankfulness, or gratefulness, from the Latin word <em>gratus</em> ‘pleasing, thankful’, is a feeling of appreciation felt by and/or similar positive response shown by the recipient of kindness, gifts, help, favors, or other types of generosity, towards the giver of such gifts.”</span>
In layman’s terms: “Gratitude is an emotion expressing appreciation for what one has — as opposed to, for instance, a consumer-driven emphasis on what one wants or thinks they need.”
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benefits of Gratitude</span></h1>
In positive psychology research, gratitude is strongly and consistently associated with greater happiness. Gratitude helps people feel more positive emotions, relish good experiences, improve their health, deal with adversity, and build strong relationships.
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why bother?</span></h1>
Maybe because the alternative is pessimism and pessimism can often turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy. Most humans in the 21st century tend to be pessimistic because they see it all around them — you check your phone after waking up in the morning, and the first thing you see is a Facebook rant on how unfortunate life is, or yet another “Why I left Buzzfeed?” video.
When we see such things, our mindset tends to wire itself to think in such ways. In other words, we see what we look for. When things do not go the way we want them to, we often feel disappointed and tend to blame others. This tendency to externalize blame can often work against you. Rather than thinking what someone else conspired to bring your downfall, think what you can do to avoid such pitfalls in the future. As one Waterloo alumni spoke regarding failure:
<blockquote><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The cost of failure is a lesson. The lesson is repeated until it is  learned.”</span></blockquote>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ways  to incorporate Gratitude into your life</span></h1>
<ol><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><i>Keep a gratitude journal. </i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Ryan Holiday (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">my favorite author) </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">said in many of his </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">writings,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> start your day by journaling. You might say, “you expect me to find time before my 8:30 class to fucking write?” I thought exactly the same when I first read up on this, but it can be very simple and rewarding. After waking up, simply write down one thing you are grateful for. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b><i>Thank someone mentally.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> No time to write? It may help to just think of how someone has helped you or made your day better.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><b>Visualize.</b><b style="font-weight: 400;"> </b></i>This may sound a bit extreme, but imagine someone you deeply love dying. This practice is very disturbing and rightfully so. It is designed to help you feel grateful for that individual’s presence in your life. If you want to take this to the next level, call them up, tell them what they mean to you, and that you love them. This will make both your days much better.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b><i>Start slow.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> One habit that has personally helped me is not checking social media for the first hour after waking up. I feel this gives me time to wake up naturally, rather than being bombarded by notifications about other people’s lives which don’t impact me in any way. This also feeds into the first point about journaling; rather than starting your day by checking social media, you could spend that time on yourself.</span></li></ol></ol>
If you are still reading this, I hope I have been able to provide you with at least one idea to cultivate gratitude in your life. This was my first article for mathNEWS; hopefully they’ll progressively get better. See you in two weeks.

<article><title>6 reasons why you should transfer to Arts</title>
<content>Hello! Did you know that you don’t have to be part of the math faculty to write for mathNEWS?? Me neither. Until now.
Yes, I am from the Faculty of Arts. Majoring in Peace and Conflict Studies and minoring in Sexuality, Marriage and Family Studies. It’s quite the mouthful, but dreadfully interesting. So why am I here? Well, obviously because mathNEWS is the best publication on campus and I wanted to contribute. Hopefully, I can hit mathNEWS with a fresh perspective as I imagine there are not many of us arts students sharing our point of view here. Although the Faculty of Arts here at UWaterloo has some major downsides, I do believe that it is the best place to spend your undergrad. Rest assured, I will come here during the term to address and complain about some of those downsides, but not before I make one valiant attempt to convince you that you should transfer into Arts (or at least appreciate it for the best faculty).
<h2>1. No class on Fridays</h2>
Seriously, I don’t know any Arts students who have class on Friday. I’m not sure if it’s because we don’t have labs and tutorials,  or what, but this is no lie. By the way, the lack of labs and tutorials is another plus because it means with a full course load, you’ll never have more than 15 hours of class per week — the dream.
<h2>2. Never have classes in the prison that is MC again*</h2>
Although the arts lecture hall is actually one of the shittiest buildings on campus, it’s not like all our classes are there. In fact, I’m in third year and I’ve only had 2 lectures there. A math student told me that all math classes take place in MC, so that’s rough.** I don’t need to tell you that it’s like a prison in here. (Although I will admit that these new computer labs where mathNEWS meetings are held are pretty fresh.)
*this is not 100% true because I had a first-year political science class here.
**I’m trusting the math student, so don’t get angry if it’s not true.
<h2>3. Skip class and still pass</h2>
I almost called this point “don’t try and still pass”, but then I thought that writing 15–20 page essays (which is standard for upper-year courses) definitely counts as trying, and when you have multiple of those suckers in a semester it actually gets pretty legit. But I can confirm that Arts has the most skippable classes across all faculties. This is because you don’t always need to attend class to be able to write a bangin’ final essay (because it’s often an independent research essay and only needs to involve the actual course content very loosely).  So, as the term goes on, those 15 hours of class a week become…less…
<h2>4. Get a fancy program name (sounds impressive)</h2>
Majoring in Pure Math? No one even knows what that is. Isn’t all math pure math? Just kidding,  y’all probably know what pure math is because you’re in math. As I’m writing this though, it’s becoming a moot point because wtf is even peace and conflict studies. I can’t even count the number of times people look at me and then say politely, “and what do you want to do with that?” Ugh. Let’s move on.
<h2>5. Everyone is getting laid.</h2>
It’s a well-known fact. Related: people are sociable and like to talk to each other.
<h2>6. You can still write for mathNEWS</h2>
So you don’t have to give up your favourite thing about the math faculty and free pizza every other week.
There is no loss here.

<article><title>Stairway Constants, part [0,1)</title>
<content>In the W19 term, a number line was added to the north-northeast stairwell in MC (the one near the DC and M3 bridges), putting CC’s 2018 review of vertical transportation mechanisms in MC out of date. Well, things haven’t changed that much. If anything, the number line has only further solidified the stairwell’s position as the nicest one in MC. Perhaps now it is also the most educational stairwell in UW.
But is it really educational, or just an expensive spiral of black paint? What can we learn from this piece of art (and the wealth of mathematical knowledge on the Internet)? I invite you out for a walk: MC north-northeast stairwell, basement level. Bring this article with you.
<h3>Floor 0</h3>
“This place exists?” Of course there’s a Floor 0. What kind of heretics would start their number line at 1? You look around, and there’s not much down here other than a really loud pipe and a door you’re not allowed to open. It’s as if this landing exists solely to host the start of the number line.
To the left of the big pink 0, the black number line gives you a taste of the negative numbers, until it runs into the wall around -0.2. (You remark that they could have fit -1/12 in there, and wonder why they didn’t.)
Slightly to the right of the big pink 0 is a silvery plaque:
<link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_f197a769d73713aef25da0891cc90833e3d3731c.pdf"></link>
<em><strong>arbitrarily small positive number</strong></em>
After taking calculus, the response is automatic: there exists a positive <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_e1bc2428d1722784d6e55a41d6b22f72b1fb7f23.pdf"></link> which is sufficiently small to guarantee that something else is less than <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_f197a769d73713aef25da0891cc90833e3d3731c.pdf"></link>. In that sense, <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_e1bc2428d1722784d6e55a41d6b22f72b1fb7f23.pdf"></link> is also an arbitrarily small positive number, but disappointingly, they seem to have left it out.
Or maybe it’s just a bit further along. You turn right and begin to follow the line. The tick marks count up by the hundredths, and you count 11 before you get to the next number. Unfortunately, it’s not <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_e1bc2428d1722784d6e55a41d6b22f72b1fb7f23.pdf"></link>.

<em><strong>Liouville’s constant</strong></em>
<em><strong> 0.11000100000…</strong></em>
(For more digits, see OEIS A012245.) Joseph Liouville was a 19th century French mathematician, known for proving the existence of transcendental numbers. The proof goes like this:
<ol><li>Lemma: Liouville numbers exist.</li>
<li>Lemma: all Liouville numbers are transcendental.</li>
<li>Profit.</li></ol>
A transcendental number is a number that is not the root of any polynomial with integer coefficients. Transcendental numbers are some of the most interesting numbers, and include superstars like <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_5e64510b5979c4326ac06b0670989041115b95d7.pdf"></link>, <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_ab6ccf699bb92a32d76c95cb54f5ae6d0fe5dd97.pdf"></link>, and <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_9c3385d3351783924cbb670ee56fbd061c0406c3.pdf"></link>.
But what are these magical Liouville numbers? To discuss them, we need a concept of approximation for real numbers. Take Liouville’s constant (<link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_beadc084773dc727b95854dcc1667b5893e6c095.pdf"></link>), for example. One way to approximate <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_beadc084773dc727b95854dcc1667b5893e6c095.pdf"></link> is with a sequence of rational numbers that converges to it. For a first attempt, let the <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_ab9c3c8c3b0d080190187f2c2a5f20ce04acacad.pdf"></link>th term be the closest rational number that has the denominator <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_ab9c3c8c3b0d080190187f2c2a5f20ce04acacad.pdf"></link>.
<link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_ae1f0a4f3bcd74a66e24a62c6db09cfac01a93fd.pdf"></link>
At most, we’re off by <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_30543e37fa367ad18abf2f4008bedacb595b26f4.pdf"></link>, so the approximations get closer to <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_beadc084773dc727b95854dcc1667b5893e6c095.pdf"></link> as the sequence goes on… really slowly. What if we only kept “good approximations”: the fractions with denominator <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_ab9c3c8c3b0d080190187f2c2a5f20ce04acacad.pdf"></link> that are within <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_b090c27129f2ebbf5c9ab011983c51365243bc24.pdf"></link> of <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_beadc084773dc727b95854dcc1667b5893e6c095.pdf"></link>?
<link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_52789f06ee2f0b7574776c460c53e35b690dcad1.pdf"></link>
This converges much faster. In theory, we could make the closeness criteria as strict as we want. <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_764e9f87229203c17f23b0cd43bbbd092a0600af.pdf"></link>? <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_e9337c36976e03cb7d09d4bcebac50ceb95ab9b0.pdf"></link>? As long as there are infinitely many of these “really good” approximations, we can form a sequence that converges to <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_beadc084773dc727b95854dcc1667b5893e6c095.pdf"></link>. However, this is impossibly rare. <span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_5e64510b5979c4326ac06b0670989041115b95d7.pdf"></link> can at best be approximated by an infinite sequence with a precision of <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_b090c27129f2ebbf5c9ab011983c51365243bc24.pdf"></link>.*</span>
* Contingent on a very recent paper by N. A. Carella that probably hasn’t been peer reviewed yet.
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Liouville numbers are those impossibly rare numbers. They are defined as all numbers which have infinitely many rational approximations within a margin of <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_f42d987c9f4591c88faf30df74f9f24463d2ed62.pdf"></link> — for any <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_ba46618ec0ffc257b9651066848682ffc61d2ba0.pdf"></link>. Even if I take <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_af487db8ced5fabe7a724bbf36ccbf876912e5be.pdf"></link>, I can find a fraction <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_dc60774a7de8d002ebacc1655d716ea64df80061.pdf"></link>, which is within <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_9763b58e308bf1dcb77f4eb28ad7990f806bbf06.pdf"></link> of Liouville’s constant. And then I can find another, and another, and another… infinitely many of them.</span>
Liouville proved the existence of his numbers by showing that for any integer <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_03512461ad7a24e6a75f8ec6431c72a43c363f16.pdf"></link>, the following is a Liouville number:
<link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_1090d23f927b0d4b1bf29a24e4ec678333eb359c.pdf"></link>
If you plug in <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_da5c401fee32ede68ed7d1e71e60db43a71c8679.pdf"></link>, you get <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_beadc084773dc727b95854dcc1667b5893e6c095.pdf"></link>, Liouville’s constant. (If you would rather work in binary, plug in <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_4a84f9befaf437a2430dca4d29ab45c00a57dffd.pdf"></link>, and check out OEIS A092874.) <em>Exercise: find a rational number <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_dc60774a7de8d002ebacc1655d716ea64df80061.pdf"></link> which is within <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_81fb88f060b9519869478a9dbbfd5ef696350422.pdf"></link> of <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_beadc084773dc727b95854dcc1667b5893e6c095.pdf"></link>.</em>
<h3>Floor 0.5</h3>
The sound of fluids rushing through pipes is a bit quieter now. You are a mere 10 steps up from the great pink 0, which you can still see. Next to you is a much more imposing pink 0.5. A scientist would grumble that this style is inconsistent, because it gives 1.5 more significant figures than 1. An artist would grumble that this style makes 0.5 looks more important than 0. A mathematician would grumble that symbolically, 0.5 is a construct of our arbitrary base 10 system. At least it looks cool.
To the left and right of the questionable pink number, are two plaques:
<link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_1903839d9021e180dd790c4cc63081c63b2fe6f1.pdf"></link>
<em><strong>Prime constant</strong></em>
<em><strong> 0.4146825098…</strong></em>
(For more digits, see OEIS A051006.) Depending on how many digits of the square root of two you know, you do a double take. Is that <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_e255b6b8d61cc7aacf0e8f1bac2092305813abc6.pdf"></link>? It isn’t, but you wouldn’t be wrong about the remarkable two-ness of this number. If you convert the prime constant to base 2, you get 0.01101010001010001010… (for more digits, see OEIS A010051). The prime constant is known to be irrational, but Wikipedia says (without citation) that nobody knows whether it is transcendental. (Perhaps you can find out?) <em>Exercise: why is it called the prime constant?</em>
<link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_da171ec557a765cb62022f1ac4c2cce4300f7bb8.pdf"></link>
<em><strong>Euler-Mascheroni constant</strong></em>
<em><strong> 0.5772156649…</strong></em>
(For more digits, see OEIS A001620.) Leonhard Euler was the first person known to identify the significance of <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_da171ec557a765cb62022f1ac4c2cce4300f7bb8.pdf"></link>, and needs no introduction. Lorenzo Mascheroni was born 43 years after Euler; he mastered Euler’s techniques and calculated <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_da171ec557a765cb62022f1ac4c2cce4300f7bb8.pdf"></link> correctly to 19 decimal places by hand!* We can distinguish <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_da171ec557a765cb62022f1ac4c2cce4300f7bb8.pdf"></link> from the other umpteen numbers named after Euler because it’s the only one that’s also named after Mascheroni.
* According to http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Mascheroni.html. Fumbling my way through the Latin manuscript by Mascheroni himself, I was only able to find 16 digits.
But what is <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_da171ec557a765cb62022f1ac4c2cce4300f7bb8.pdf"></link>? Everyone who hasn’t forgotten first-year calculus should be familiar with the pain of Riemann sums:
<link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_62c7e1947a4054c9d4cbf9bc7ee9c2fd74d5d57f.pdf"></link>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">But this is pretty nifty: if we don’t have a calculator, we can add up a bunch of simple reciprocals by hand to approximate <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_d12b6f9121e51fe5cbed8adbfe7676752b7613fc.pdf"></link>. The only problem is, we overshoot by a bit, because this is an upper</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Riemann sum. At <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_ecd244b6839b337265098cfb82618b61b5ee2595.pdf"></link>, the error is more than 0.5; at <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_dcec4380287bef26f5d89ac68b372509e2c9d7b2.pdf"></link>, the error is more than 0.57. Keep increasing <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_ba46618ec0ffc257b9651066848682ffc61d2ba0.pdf"></link> and eventually the error exceeds 0.577, then 0.5772, then 0.57721… and so you get the digits of the Euler-Mascheroni constant. (</span>This is not a good way to compute <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_da171ec557a765cb62022f1ac4c2cce4300f7bb8.pdf"></link>.)

In a nutshell, the Euler-Mascheroni constant is the error term of an ambitious crossover event between the discrete and continuous worlds of mathematics. Because of this, it pops up in all sorts of weird places. Perhaps the coolest example is Robin’s Theorem. If you find a number <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_a0f9950d98601075b3b88a5d99808ec3c33b4989.pdf"></link> whose positive divisors (including 1 and itself) sum to more than <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_197d9f0ffc6fe030be1a89cf38640c7b9cdffe0e.pdf"></link>, you will have refuted the Riemann hypothesis. If you prove that no such number exists, then you prove the Riemann hypothesis. <em>Exercise: prove or disprove the Riemann hypothesis.</em>
<h3>Floor 1</h3>
Climbing another 10 stairs, you return to civilization from the depths of the basement. A big pink 1 greets you with congratulations. This is where we leave off, but before you can exit, another plaque introduces itself.
<link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_8a7329cade99323c47c4e28a88efde832fdb9d44.pdf"></link>
<em><strong>Gauss’s constant</strong></em>
<em> <strong>0.8346268416…</strong></em>
(For more digits, see OEIS A014549.) Like Euler, Gauss needs no introduction. However, his constant likely does. Rooted in the depths of very hard integrals, Gauss’s constant is involved in a great number of seemingly unrelated problems under topics like:
<ul><li>the gamma function</li>
<li>the arc length of an <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_e050a7060d0c948bdd41661364b8af5fe63fd25d.pdf"></link>-shaped curve called the lemniscate of (Jakob) Bernoulli</li>
<li>definite integrals of <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_a7cfd28f5b287c28c6f02247ef5f74715add508b.pdf"></link> and <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_bec1da315a1c18a874331b86f5a1c9bb234bcc82.pdf"></link></li></ul>
In fact, the constant is named after Gauss because he proved that <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_8a7329cade99323c47c4e28a88efde832fdb9d44.pdf"></link> is the value of yet another very hard definite integral. Thus, with regard to undergraduate math, Gauss’s constant is probably the most esoteric one so far. Nonetheless, its definition is well within our grasp. <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_8a7329cade99323c47c4e28a88efde832fdb9d44.pdf"></link> is the reciprocal of the arithmetic-geometric mean of two simple numbers: 1 and <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_880c2d0b4fffd737508bcfc292c844ea62f78e96.pdf"></link>.

<article><title>III. Lambdas? Oh, you mean functors?</title>
<content>Shut up. The C++ Police are close. I can hear them. The editors too. They’re going to string me up in the plaza and kill me. But first, I have one more secret I am to bestow unto you. Listen carefully. Okay:
Remember lambdas? How do they work? Why? Who cares? Me. I mean, those must’ve been pretty hard to implement, eh? Pretty radical, being able to just have a function be an object like that. I bet they went to some lengths to write that into GCC.
Wrong. Wrong; wrong; wrong. You know how lambdas act like objects, right? Well, I shouldn’t say they <em>act</em><em> like objects</em> — rather, they <em>are</em> objects. Okay, then an object needs a type. We’ve been glossing over this fact by just declaring our lambdas with <code>auto</code> all the time, but that seems rather obstructionist, hm? Let’s take a look.
<pre><code><mathnews--code-strong>int </mathnews--code-strong>main() {
<mathnews--code-strong>  int</mathnews--code-strong> x;
    auto fun = [=]() mutable -&gt; void {  // <mathnews--code-strong>Test</mathnews--code-strong><mathnews-pre--ruby>␣</mathnews-pre--ruby> <mathnews-pre--ruby>↪</mathnews-pre--ruby>line breaks that go on and on and on and on<mathnews-pre--ruby>␣</mathnews-pre--ruby> <mathnews-pre--ruby>↪</mathnews-pre--ruby>and on and on and on and on and on and on for<mathnews-pre--ruby>␣</mathnews-pre--ruby> <mathnews-pre--ruby>↪</mathnews-pre--ruby>it simply never stops.
    ++x;
    std::cout &lt;&lt; __func__ &lt;&lt; ": " &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt;<mathnews-pre--ruby>␣</mathnews-pre--ruby> <mathnews-pre--ruby>↪</mathnews-pre--ruby>std::endl;
  };
  fun(); fun(); fun();
}</code></pre>
Compile this code. What does it print?
<pre><code>operator(): 1
operator(): 2
operator(): 3</code></pre>
Oh, neat, the modified copy-capture of <code>x</code> gets preserved across invocations of the lambda. Also, hey, I thought that operator() was a member function given to classes to make them act like… oh… oh no. Computer, <em>enhance</em>.
<pre><code><mathnews-pre--lineno-start><mathnews--code-strong>int</mathnews--code-strong> main() {</mathnews-pre--lineno-start>
<mathnews-pre--lineno>  <mathnews--code-strong>int</mathnews--code-strong> x = 0;
  <mathnews--code-strong>auto</mathnews--code-strong> fun = [=]() <mathnews--code-em>mutable</mathnews--code-em> -&gt; <mathnews--code-strong>void</mathnews--code-strong> {
    ++x;
    std::cout &lt;&lt; <mathnews--code-u>__PRETTY_FUNCTION__</mathnews--code-u> &lt;&lt;<mathnews-pre--ruby>␣</mathnews-pre--ruby> <mathnews-pre--ruby>↪</mathnews-pre--ruby>std::endl;
  };
  fun(); fun(); fun();
}</mathnews-pre--lineno></code></pre>
Compile this code with GCC. Run it. Tell me what it prints.
<pre><code>main()::&lt;lambda()&gt; mutable: 1
main()::&lt;lambda()&gt; mutable: 2
main()::&lt;lambda()&gt; mutable: 3</code></pre>
Okay. So, you probably learned in a certain second-year CS course that classes in C++ can be fitted with an <code>operator()</code> method, which lets you “invoke” objects of the class as if the+y were a function. In an effort to sound like mathematicians, we call a class equipped with this method a <em>functor</em>. The nice thing about these so-called functors is that they <em>preserve state</em>. In particular, the data members of the class can be seen as state indicators to the function, so that information can be preserved across invocations. Here’s a cute little example:
<pre><code><mathnews-pre--lineno-start><mathnews--code-strong>struct</mathnews--code-strong> <mathnews--code-strong>Functor</mathnews--code-strong> {</mathnews-pre--lineno-start>
<mathnews-pre--lineno>  int x = 0;
  void operator()() {
    ++x;
    std::cout &lt;&lt; __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ &lt;&lt;<mathnews-pre--ruby>␣</mathnews-pre--ruby> <mathnews-pre--ruby>↪</mathnews-pre--ruby>std::endl;
  }
};
int main() {
  Functor fun;
  fun(); fun(); fun();
}</mathnews-pre--lineno></code></pre>
Here’s what gets printed:
<pre><code>void Functor::operator()(): 1
void Functor::operator()(): 2
void Functor::operator()(): 3</code></pre>
Mmm. So you see how it is now, yes? This example was not so cute, nor was it arbitrarily chosen. This looks strikingly similar to what we had before. That’s because, in fact, they’re the same.
When you create a lambda, what actually happens behind the scenes is that the compiler generates a unique functor class, defining its <code><mathnews--code-strong>operator</mathnews--code-strong>()</code> method by the body of the lambda. If <code>mutable</code> is not declared in the lambda, then the <code><mathnews--code-em>operator</mathnews--code-em>()</code> method of the functor is declared <code>const</code>. All captures in the lambda become member variables for the generated functor class; those captured by copy are made direct members by copy, and those captured by reference get reference members. The functor generated by the compiler is called a <em>closure type</em>, and we say that the result of a lambda expression is called a <em>closure</em>.
Nothing new here after all, eh? It’s all syntactic sugar. But at the end of the day, isn’t that all a programming language ever is?
Now run; leave. They’ll be prying the <code>type_traits</code> out of my cold, dead hands in no time.

<article><title>The Adventures of Professor M. Goose Chapter 5</title>
<content>Well, we’re taking a break from the action, because there’s nothing readers love more than a cliffhanger, right? Because clearly the story about Professor Goose, and for some reason multiple cat themed characters, needs more tension. So anyway, here’s some insight into what our favourite professor can do:
<link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/img/The_Advent_TiKrNH8.png" src="https://i.imgur.com/TiKrNH8.png"/>
Now it is currently 7 minutes from the already extended deadline so  we’re ending here. (Also I need to ̶l̶o̶o̶k̶u̶p̶ ̶w̶h̶a̶t̶ ̶h̶a̶l̶f̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶w̶o̶r̶d̶s̶ ̶i̶n̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶s̶p̶e̶l̶l̶b̶o̶o̶k̶ ̶m̶e̶a̶n̶ do absolutely nothing because I always write about topics I am well-informed about, and also I am a real math student). There’s nothing more here so
