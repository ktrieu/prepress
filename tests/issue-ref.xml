<article><title>Interview with the Dean</title>
<content><b><i>SketchED</i></b>:  And we have the Dean of Mathematics here. <b>Is there a name you want us to use, Ian Goulden, Dean of Mathematics, overlord of the grand scheme of things?</b>
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>Ian</i></b>: Ian. I like Ian. I got my buddy Elvis here. [Walks over to Elvis bust on top of cabinet.] He’s going to listen in and see if you guys misbehave or not. He’s lookin’, gonna check you guys out. He sits up here during certain meetings.
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>SketchED</i></b>: Very specific meetings?
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>Ian</i></b>: No, quite random ones. Sometimes we have people here in three-piece suits, and you see them all of a sudden looking over there and seeing if I seriously intended him to be there or not. I try not to show any smile or anything like that.
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>SketchED</i></b>: Alright, Ian, are you ready for the questions we’ll be embarking on from here?
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>Ian</i></b>: No, I’m trying to distract you.
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>SketchED</i></b>: Oh, I see. It has been working quite well so far. But it’s too late; we’re now going to make you answer our questions. Alright, so, we’re going to start with something basic, something easy. <b>What is your favourite pun that anyone has ever made with your name or title?</b>
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>Ian</i></b>: My title! I can’t repeat it, but it does involve the adjectival form for Dean, which is decanal, and tan, but I can’t repeat it for a family publication.
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>SketchED</i></b>: Family publication? Have you seen cosMATHpolitan?

<b><i>MuffinED</i></b>:<b> Do you have a favourite math joke?  </b>
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>Ian</i></b>: I like: “There are only 10 types of people in the world: those who understand binary and those who don’t.” It’s good; kinda inclusive of our CS colleagues.
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>SketchED</i></b>: Do you also consider software engineers are our colleagues as well?
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>

<b><i>SketchED</i></b>: We’re going to ask you something in a more serious tone here, as we know <b>it’s your last term here, yes?</b> I wanted to confirm this.
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>Ian</i></b>: It is my first and last term; lasts five years and it ends June 30th, 2015.
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>SketchED</i></b>: That’s still quite a long way to go, in terms of months left.
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>Ian</i></b>: Less than 300 days but more than 256.
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>MuffinED</i></b>: Are you counting down?
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>Ian</i></b>: No, but I do have a colleague, a long time Chair, who sends me email periodically when we reach the next power of two. So on day minus 512, he sent me an email, so I hope to get in my email for day minus 256 before he does. Quite juvenile, isn’t it?
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>MuffinED</i></b>: Oh no, it’s pretty awesome, actually.

<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>SketchED</i></b>: <b>What do you hope to do after you leave the University of Waterloo?</b>
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>Ian</i></b>: I have been a professor here since 1980, and my position is a professor of combinatorics and optimisation, and my role as Dean is an extra, separate, administrative appointment for five years only, and throughout I’m a tenured professor. The moment I stop being Dean, I revert back to being a professor of combinatorics and optimisation.
By the time I stop being Dean, I’ll be 60 — that’s in base ten — and I guess I’ll sleep, try to do some mathematics. I have a year’s sabbatical, and I promised my wife and myself that I wouldn’t make any decisions until six months in about what I’ll do next. But after a few months of my sabbatical, I might even prove a theorem again, doing some math. I might just retire, but more likely, I’ll come back and do some regular teaching and graduate supervisions and research as a faculty member and retire in a few years.
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>SketchED</i></b>: I just wanted a moment to say that I’m happy it’s not necessarily your end as Dean here. You are — well, technically you are my only Dean — but you have shown a positive light, and I hope that the next Dean is as good as you, and I’m happy that you’re staying, because that means you’ll be able to still be here and still contribute. Maybe mathNEWS will want to do another interview again, just next time as a professor instead.
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>Ian</i></b>: Maybe I’ll inflict my teaching upon you.

<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>MuffinED</i></b>: <b>Do you have anything on your bucket list, anything you really want to do before you finish as Dean?</b> Like you being carried onto a chariot during Orientation, you being carried on a boat, those sorts of things.
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>Ian</i></b>: Ah, I don’t have a head for heights. I’ve got one single-most important task for this year, between 256 and 300 days, and that’s the university setting up changing how we do our budget system, how money is distributed into faculties. That’s very important for the future stability of everything that we do, so I’m gonna make sure it gets my full attention. We’re changing the budget system from what’s substantially historically-based, where you get the money plus or minus some small proportion, to what’s called Activity-Based Budgeting. And, at the same time, to a multiple-year window. It only makes sense that you want to plan what the heck you’re going to be doing for future years, and you can never do some kind of greedy algorithm out the next year. So that’s going to get my full attention. It’s not like I get to set the budget scheme, but I’m a full participant as one of sixteen in the discussions with the Provost. The new Provost came from the University of Toronto, where about seven years ago they introduced the same budget system, so he’s a proponent of it, and he’s told us quite eloquently to the collection of Deans and the President the benefits of planning and being able to collaborate with others. When I and the Dean of another Faculty each know the amount of money each enrolment brings to the table, we can combine forces to more knowledgably create new and better programs.
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>bunniED</i></b>: Academic programs?
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>Ian</i></b>: Yeah, academic programs — so, for instance, software engineering is actually quite well managed on the existing budget system, because it’s a glue-on. The historical budget system has some tweaks over time, and software engineering was started relatively recently, after the University decided it could have special arrangements, so software engineering is run with a half ownership state between the Faculty of Engineering and the Faculty of Mathematics. We don’t quibble about 48–52 percent or anything stupid like that; it’s 50–50, so both have a huge scheme in the game of making it work for the students and for us. Here’s a program for which it’d be absurd for a new unit to be created, and we really should just use the existing ECE and Computer Science, enhanced with new hires to create the Software Engineering program, and that’s what was done. [There’s no] overhead of staff members in a new unit, who simply copy the function of people in Computer Science and ECE, so I think it’s really quite efficient and a really good way to go ahead. I hope we’ll be able to get more of the same arrangements between faculties.
So that has to be very high priority. There’s no, you know, skull-duggery involved. Literally, we have meetings every two weeks early Wednesday morning, and I’ve planned a whole year ahead of travel so I will never be away for those meetings.
I look forward to having another great year of hiring and recruiting and outreach. I really, really believe in having the best people around — and treating them well, of course, once they get here. But in terms of the-chicken-and-the-egg, I really think that the main lever one can push on is just to try to get the very best people, with no BS about it, to try to attract the best students. We’ve been working very hard at it, and treat people well when they get here, but I feel like our basic job is to get really smart people part of our community and challenge ‘em. The best trick is to challenge people to do something they never quite thought they could do or a little harder than they thought they could do and have them accept it as something they &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; do.
I guess one of my other tasks is, as a Faculty with only five units — the School of Computer Science and four departments — this year I have to lead a Department Chair Committee to appoint the next Chair of Combinatorics and Optimisation. That’s a very, very important job for the Dean, to make sure we appoint the very best person there. I think the department chairs and the new director of the school are really good people. They’re nice people — but they’re also smart, very good leaders, they have the attributes of causing people to want to work together — they don’t just give orders like in the army.

<b><i>bunniED</i></b>: <b>It’s interesting that a lot of the people in administration are from C&amp;O, like yourself and Professor Furino.</b>
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>Ian</i></b>: Yes, perhaps so. I think it cycles a bit.
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>bunniED</i></b>: Does it? I guess I haven’t been here long enough to know.
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>Ian</i></b>: Yes, I think in times past there have been a disproportionate number in the Statistics Department. I don’t think there’s any disciplinary bias or any self-selection there at all. I don’t know; maybe it should be a research study.
And, I guess in a general sense, I would like to leave a house that’s in order for whoever is the next Dean — I would never want to have a short-term gain for someone else’s long-term pain. And I’d like to have a house that’s in order, but make sure that we go ahead on all or some of these issues.
I can give infinite answers to almost everything.

<b><i>SketchED</i></b>: All right, we’ll move on on the list then? We know Waterloo has a lot of different places to eat; I’m really sad there’s no Filipino places in Waterloo, but that’s just me — that’s in my blood, I love Filipino food. But we’re not going to talk about Waterloo; we’re going to talk in general, you know: food. <b>What is the most interesting food you’ve ever eaten?</b> Whether it’d be here, or just in Canada, or around the globe.
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>Ian</i></b>: When I’ve been in trips to China, and the only one in my group who will eat whatever the host offers. And — point of pride or lunacy — it doesn’t matter; it could be thousand-year-old egg, a hundred-year-old egg, or whatever they call it, or some kind of squid or sea cucumber, I always kept a straight face and ate everything, toast everything. Some of it tasted just awful! And between toasts, it was just a very interesting experience.
I have two daughters who are teenagers and we adopted them both in China. And so, my wife and I went there two weeks each time, and we’ve been back three weeks at a time when they were 9 and 11. Of course, I’ve been, as a mathematician, there four or five times. So I’ve been there many weeks and I always enjoy it, and I always try to eat whatever’s offered. And I’m still alive, so it’s pretty good!
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>SketchED</i></b>: I have two follow-ups to that. <b>So, you’ve adopted two daughters from China, right? </b>Are those your only children?
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>Ian</i></b>: Those are my only children. I’m very lucky to have them. [Points to photograph.] There are my daughters, there.
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>MuffinED</i></b>: Oh, are they almost university age?
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>Ian</i></b>: Yeah, Jen, on your right — that’s about a year and a half ago — so she’s about 17 now. And Karen’s 14, nearly 15.
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>SketchED</i></b>: Are they coming to Waterloo for university?
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>bunniED</i></b>: For math?
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>Ian</i></b>: I don’t think so. But they have accepted that there aren’t too many math tutors who can even pronounce “trigonometry”, so they have to put up with dear old dad telling them some things about mathematics. Right now, Jen is in grade 12, so we’re doing a functions course right now, and we’ll have the joy of calculus in the winter.
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>SketchED</i></b>: Do you teach them how to do math the Proper Way, or do you do what my parents do — or basically what my mom did — “look at this question, here’s the answer”. “How the hell did you do that?” It’s just over my head.
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>Ian</i></b>: Well, you know, whenever I say to Jennifer, well, let’s go back to first principles, she just rolls her eyes and says, “Dad! Not the first principles! I just want to know how to do it.” So we have a little bit of tension about that.
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>SketchED</i></b>: And one more follow-up, if you don’t mind — you say that you’ll eat anything.
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>Ian</i></b>: Please don’t take that as a challenge. I will not eat that camera. [Points to video camera recording the interview.]
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>SketchED</i></b>: Edible food — we’ll talk about edible food!
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>Ian</i></b>: I won’t eat that stuffed animal you have there. [Points to Kitty, the mathNEWS mascot.]
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>SketchED</i></b>: That technically is edible! <b>So there’s a dish in the Philippines, and it’s called balut. </b>One thing I’ve learned is that Filipinos don’t tell you what they’re giving you to eat; they just say, “Eat it!” or “Oh, you should try this!” and then you have to figure out what it is. So they give you an egg, and it’s pretty much hard-boiled from what you can tell, but when you open it up, there’s a chick fetus in there. <b>Would you eat it?</b>
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>Ian</i></b>: Oh, isn’t that charming? It’s lovely. Kind of like the haggis of the Philippines, is it?
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>SketchED</i></b>: It’s a delicacy, apparently.
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>bunniED</i></b>: In Vietnam, too — I’ve had it many times.
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>Ian</i></b>: Yes? And you’re still alive! You look great.
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>bunniED</i></b>: I’m vegetarian now.
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>Ian</i></b>: That’s a good answer! Please don’t — I don’t want your readers to take that as a challenge, ‘cause I know there could be some really awful experiences for me. But when I’ve been to China, I’ve eaten everything that’s offered.
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>SketchED</i></b>: <b>Do you plan on going to different places to eat different things in the future?</b>
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>Ian</i></b>: You never know. I certainly would like to do a lot of travelling when I’m retired.

<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>bunniED</i></b>: I have one more question, actually. Do you know of George Hart and Vi Hart?
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>Ian</i></b>: Vi? Logarithms and other sorts of interesting things — yes! My daughter and I have gone through of some of Vi’s work. I think we went through logarithms and some other mathematical functions last year. It’s a lot of fun. She’s very good.
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>bunniED</i></b>:<b> I thought it was interesting how Vi chose not to go into math mainly because of how it was taught in school versus how her father taught it. She found it too rigid. She likes math as a concept, but not learning it formally.</b>
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>Ian</i></b>: No, and I can understand that. Just looking at what my 17-year-old is doing right now — of course, it gets filtered through her, being in the class and I not being there, she tells me about it when she comes home — that, “The teacher told us to this and that and the other and doesn’t explain why!” Of course, when I start to explain why, she says, “Oh, get on with it, dad! Just tell me how to do it!” It seems very clear that anything first principle-like seems to be avoided. In fact, I get concern because, when I work with my children, I encourage them to have scrap paper to make calculations and play, yet they seem both to fight it. They say, “The teacher wants us to present this very rigid thing in two dimensions.” There’s no room allowed to just play a little bit or for rough work, which I think everyone I know who’s successful does. I mean, there are some people with incredibly, rapier-like brains — they can do anything right in their head — but most of us, to do something, we need to play before we get the right concept down.

<strong><strong> </strong></strong>

<b><i>Ian</i></b>: You asked me about being carried to Orientation. After some initial fear, I found it very uplifting.
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>SketchED</i></b>: <b>About Orientation: I was a leader the first time you were ever put on a boat. What exactly happened there? I was out of the loop there, as a front-line leader — all of a sudden we just found the Dean on a boat that was not meant to carry people</b>.
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>Ian</i></b>: I just did what I was told. I didn’t really care.
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>SketchED</i></b>: So someone was like, “Yo, you want to get on a boat, I’ll push you through”?
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>Ian</i></b>: Sure! In for a penny, in for a pound. I didn’t worry about it. In my point of view, seriously — and I’m almost never serious, as you can tell — you’ve got fifteen hundred first-year students coming to university, almost all of them coming to university for the first time, many of them coming to a new city, a new country. Integrating that many people into a community of 65 hundred undergrads, 200 faculty members, a huge university and big residences… That’s really hard for anyone; it’s as scary as heck. And it can seem quite faceless because it’s so massive. So I very, very much believe that, no matter how our community seems in absolute numbers, the whole spirit of it is people — everything about any institute is people — and that there are lots of very good individuals here. In fact, I believe — maybe it’s me being an optimist — that, in the large majority, we have really good-hearted people here: students, support staff, faculty members. And not everybody is — people can be unpleasant from time to time on all sides, but I really believe that the majority are really good-hearted people. If a student needs a break, if a student needs some help, there’s people here for them.
So having something, a warm-up, that causes people to be integrated in a community, maybe something where they’re not thinking about what they’re doing and think, “Hey, this is kind of fun. I met ten people today and fifty people this week”, you can almost trick people into forgetting that they’re lonesome or out of their element, and say, “That was pretty good.” I really believe in that a lot. And I think a really good way for that is that an institution, such as a faculty, shouldn’t think itself too wonderful. I think if the Dean, and Chairs, and faculty members kind of let down their hair and show that they don’t need to be taken seriously all the time, that’s good. So if students want to have a pirate boat or some chariot or whatever it is, I don’t mind. We’re just a pink tie place, for crying out loud! It’s good fun. We’ve got lots of pink ties here, and it’s good. I’m happy to go laugh at it and spray pink all over my head and all that. My colleagues — you know, there’s twenty colleagues there who are thrilled to hand out ties to fifty students and they’re having a whale of a time. If we told the faculty, “Oh, you can’t come, somebody else has to hand out the ties”, they’d be upset. There’s always good people, the students seem to have fun — they go nuts on their selfies and all that, it’s great!
I really believe that Orientation warm-up — nice weather, knowing that people aren’t too stressed by work yet — is really good. You can have too much of any good thing, right? If you do something for two days, should you do it for two weeks? Well, no — you shouldn’t have four weeks of Orientation — as long as there’s some period of Orientation. It doesn’t even have to have too much of the serious message stuff. I actually kind of think the serious message stuff gets in the way a bit. As an institution, obviously, it’s a very serious business; we give grades, some students fail, some people get good jobs, some people get bad jobs, it’s incredibly serious — but showing that we don’t take ourselves seriously all the time is a really good message. And, as many of my friends have told me, I kept my immaturity for a reason.

<b><i>MuffinED</i></b>: <b>For non-CS majors, it’s still very difficult to take CS courses. Given that the workplace is moving more and more towards people with computer skills, what is the Faculty of Math’s response?</b>
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>Ian</i></b>: My observation is that there are jobs for people in coding and analysis — those are pretty hard-core jobs. There’s an awful lot of jobs where basic computing skills are all that’s required. In fact, part of requiring communication skills too for all of our students is the mantra that’s been chanted at me from every business person that I’ve met. I put on my suit and tie uniform and I meet some CEO about students and the faculty, and they all say reasonably similar versions of, “Your students are fantastically brilliant and great with analytic skills.” And then there’s often a “but” about softer skills like communication or teamwork, which isn’t meant to be a knock. I don’t take it as a knock — because you’re always going to be better at something than something else. But it’s absolutely clear that you don’t need to know hard-core computer science to have a great job. You don’t have to be a back-room analytics person to work in the analytic ends of business.
We have differential fees for computer science courses, and we have an awful lot of computer science majors, and limited space, and we have a hiring freeze — we can’t expand that quickly to hire professors. We really do want to hire the best professors, and we can’t ramp up quickly in anything that we do because we might not hire the very best people. It’s just a very hard game that we’re in.
I don’t think that it’s so hard for people to get jobs on the edge of software. But what I think is best about our students, and what has been true for forty years since I’ve been here, but moreso now, is that we’ve got really enumerate people who are never afraid of any formula or any software. That’s true of people whether they’re computer science majors or not. That’s my observation — it might be naive. I often, when talking to people who are having trouble getting jobs, find aspects of what they’ve done or attributes of them that maybe also seem to get in the way. But it might be impolite to tell them. I also observed, with respect to communication skills — I was for tens of years an undergraduate advisor before I was Dean or Chair — the students who most need an attribute are often the least likely to take one’s advice to go and get that. I think, for instance, taking one’s electives — with economics, business, English, or various other types of skills — are really useful things to do. I know a lot of students, in my experience, to have fled those as well.
We just have a very large supply of computer science majors — if they pass, if they get good grades, of course they continue to be computer science majors — we have a limited supply of professors and rooms. We try to keep them in match, but we don’t have a lot of overflow or surplus. We’re working on our computer science courses for non-majors actively in the school.
We also, for ever more, have a core in the faculty that I really believe in. A pure math student says, “I don’t want to take statistics or computer science!” Well, they all have to take statistics and computer science and probability. And computer science students say, “I don’t want to do anything but code!” But they have to take calculus and algebra and probability and statistics. I think that’s good for us and always has been. When we’re in three separate buildings, it helps build bridges, metaphorically and actually, both for our students and our faculty members. I think that what the outside world sees from our students is that the internal differences that we feel between our computer science majors and even a math-business major really are not big differences. Every student here is taking at least twenty math major courses. That’s a major number. Think of BComm, you might take baby calculus and cookbook statistics and an Excel spreadsheet course. I’m quite convinced, over time, that our employers see our students, when they’re not hard-core coding development jobs, they see our students much more analytic, software-end. And there’s a lot of people doing those jobs.  When I heard the alumni panels talking to students — we had one for Women in Computer Science a year and a half ago or so — their big observation was if you didn’t want to be a coder for life, you had to have these other skills.

<b><i>SketchED</i></b>: <b>What is your thought on mathNEWS from the past — how you remember it from back then — and its current state, and possibly the future of mathNEWS?</b>
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>Ian</i></b>: I think: Long live mathNEWS!
Maybe you’ll have to give into the online thing. It might be tempting to become a webpage. And maybe that’s what you should do — I don’t know, I have no comment on it — but I think it’s really cool to have a tactile thing, to get a dozen pages Friday morning. It’s a tradition. It’s a physical object that my fundraising, alumni people take out, that I take out, when we go visit alumns out there. It’s the one piece that they don’t throw out immediately when they get it, and they’re actually interested in it, and they open it and smile. It’s mathNEWS. The fact that it’s not just isomorphic, but almost identical to what they remember is really cool to them. I’ve been here for 42 years — it’s a heck of a thing. That kind of timelessness is kind of nice. Being physically there, appearing in the hallways Friday morning — I guess it used to be that, famously, people stayed up late all Monday night, Lord knows what they did in those rooms — it’s always the same. Sometimes there are articles that are ruder than others, sometimes there’s some stupid stuff, sometimes there’s some clever stuff, sometimes they go through a round of different puzzles and that; they always have profQUOTES. So I can tell you that people who were here fifty years ago, or forty years ago, thirty years ago, maybe twenty years ago — they open their mathNEWS, big grin on their face, and they look at profQUOTES. I think it’s really good. I don’t know if you feel pressure or not to exist in your current form — I hope not.
At the end of the day, though, is it not the case that you want to get stuff out Friday morning for students who have got their Friday morning classes, and you’re happier than heck when your piles of mathNEWS are gone early in the day. Is that fair?
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>SketchED</i></b>: Yes, it’s always fun watching people get copies of mathNEWS.
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>Ian</i></b>: My assistant Allison usually gets one of whatever colour it is — I like the different colours, that’s cool. We have one sitting on my table every week that Allison gets it.
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>SketchED</i></b>: So what’s your favourite article?
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>
<b><i>Ian</i></b>: No idea. I basically scan the profQUOTES, and just have a look at it, and don’t worry about it. Do I read the Globe and Mail? No, I’m just an illiterate son of a gun.</content></article>
<article><title>Fight Breaks Out on Roof of Davis Centre</title>
<content><strong>Waterloo, ON</strong> — Last Tuesday, two unidentified individuals were observed to be engaged in a standoff atop the Davis Centre that eventually came to blows. Witnesses reported they didn’t notice anything unusual until a loud, disembodied voice shouted “GO!”, at which time they looked around and noticed two figures on the roof of the nearby DC atrium. It is uncertain how the fighters gained access to the roof, which is normally off limits to all non-maintenance personnel. One witness claims to have seen the two individuals jump out of pipes, but a search of the roof failed to locate any locations where a pipe large enough for a human to fit inside would have been visible from the ground.
According to observers, the smaller of the two fighters (here identified as “One” pending police identification) jumped at the second (here “Two”) while attempting to throw a punch, but Two rolled out of the way and followed up with a devastating uppercut to One’s shoulder. One was launched up into the air; Two jumped, attempting to follow up, but One pulled out a red shield and deflected Two’s attack. Both fighters were unable to move until they touched the ground. Simultaneously, they dove for an over-sized hammer that had appeared nearby. One got there just in time and began swinging the hammer at Two, who had realized it was too late to turn around. One connected with the hammer; Two was launched off the roof and exploded in a burst of red light, but One continued to swing the hammer, somehow unable to let go.
By some miracle, Two appeared again a few seconds later, on a metal platform suspended above the roof. Two growled with rage and pulled out a small firearm, taking several pot-shots at One while One rushed forward yet again. Although every shot hit its mark, One was undeterred and Two managed to get out of the way just in time as One leapt forward with another jumping attack. This would prove to be a tactical failure for One, who was sent flying off of the roof with the force of the jump and could not control their fall or recover. A puff of smoke was all that was left of One at this point.
However, One was back atop the roof and back in the fight. The combatants traded blows for a few minutes, neither managing to land a decisive hit but both visibly sweating and steaming after a string of several solid hits and near misses. At this point, several witnesses reported some kind of glowing weather balloon or inflatable ball had been caught by the wind and was blown toward the rooftop. The fighters seemed to take immense interest in this orb and broke off the attack, each attempting to out-race the other and get to the ball first. One bull-rushed toward the orb and was making good headway, but Two, in a desperation move, lit himself on fire and used the force of the exploding air to propel himself toward the orb. Two made first contact but was unable to break the ball; One took a chance and jumped off of Two’s head but could not get enough vertical distance to reach the balloon. Two, remembering his firearm, shot the ball until it broke, at which point a large tank fell from the sky and crushed One, blasting him into the stratosphere.
After the fight, One could not be located for comment; however, Two, as the winner of the fight, proudly came down from the roof to speak to the gathered crowd. He said the DC roof was chosen because it was, according to him, “a good stage… no gimmicks”, but was upset at the appearance of the hammer during the fight.
“I thought we agreed, ‘No items, me only, DC rooftop’, but <i>someone</i> cares more about the fun than the glory.”
He insisted that the combat was “just something they did to blow off steam” and that neither competitor was seriously injured, despite having visibly lost their lives on several occasions.
Witnesses agree that everyone involved had a smashing good time.

<article><title>IST to Implement RFC 1149-Compliant Wireless Network</title>
<content><strong>Waterloo, ON</strong> — Coming on the heels of the recent announcement of the demise of the <em>uw-unsecured</em> wireless access network, the University of Waterloo’s Information Systems and Technology group has followed up with a surprising press release. The plan is to roll out a campus area network to replace <em>uw-unsecured</em> over the next few months. In an unprecedented move, the network equipment they have chosen is compliant with RFC 1149, a proposed Internet standard that describes a protocol for “…the Transmission of IP Datagrams on Avian Carriers”.
Representatives from IST have said that RFC 1149 networks do not suffer from the connection difficulties that plague <em>eduroam</em>, such as loss of signal and weak connections.
“The vendor has recommended that users keep a supply of seeds and small grains near their wireless device to ensure the highest possible signal strength. Avian carriers can be finicky, but this is a proven, field-tested solution.”
A campus-wide recycling initiative will be put in place to recycle the “scroll[s] of paper” used as the packet transmission medium by RFC 1149.
The main obstacle to deployment of this network, not surprisingly, is the presence of geese.
“We expect to see a significant number of dropped packets and lost carriers in the spring, around nesting season,” says one IST network manager. “We’re going to roll out some extensions to the base protocol to compensate for this. No one has implemented the Quality-of-Service extensions in RFC 2549 yet, but that’s never stopped us before. If we define a prioritized pecking order for our carriers, we can ensure that essential services are preserved during periods of disruption.”
The cost to the University is expected to be recovered in the long term, as the carriers work for birdseed and self-regenerate. Additional worm detection and elimination would be provided to users of the service at no extra cost.
Members of a competing firm putting together a proposal for a campus-wide deployment of an RFC 6921 (“Design Considerations for Faster-than-Light Communication”) network were unavailable for comment at time of printing.

<article><title>The C&amp;Ds of UW</title>
<content>Many people here at UW go to Tim Horton’s for their morning coffee, as they provide fast double doubles on the go. However, for those of us who prefer cheaper coffee, or just don’t like Tim Hortons, there are faculty-run C&amp;Ds. I’ve been to all of them, except for the Environment C&amp;D. They have something called fair trade coffee, which is higher in price compared to the coffee in the other C&amp;Ds.
In my opinion, the Math C&amp;D is the spaciest, with more selection than the other C&amp;Ds, and each cup of coffee is about 75 cents. The Engineering C&amp;D has a similar selection to Math’s, but the space inside the C&amp;D is cramped. The coffee is cheap if you bring in your own mug (about 60 cents). The Science C&amp;D is the most relaxed one, and you can even bring backpacks into it! The price of each cup is the same as Engineering, but there is a limited variety of coffees and snacks.
Math and Engineering C&amp;Ds have different types of flavoured coffee, hot chocolate/cappuccinos (both pricier than coffee), a selection of donuts, and other foods. Neither of the C&amp;Ds allow for backpacks in the store, nor accept Watcard — only the Math C&amp;D accepts debit cards. The Math and Engineering C&amp;Ds are also the only ones that have paid employees.
The Math C&amp;D is located on the 3rd floor of MC, Engineering on the first floor of CPH (on the south side), and Science is close to the Bio building entrance under the overpass to the ESC building.
This is only a tidbit of the C&amp;Ds of the university; I recommend exploring each one and discovering your favourite one. Enjoy your coffee and donuts!

<article><title>Investors Wanted</title>
<content>For a while now, I’ve dreamed of owning a castle in Scotland<sup>1</sup>. Not going to lie, that would be pretty cool. The problem is, those sorts of things are a little out of my price range. I’m a few pounds short of the ~3 million price tag. Then I had a brilliant idea: Crowdfunding!
Why should I have to pay the full price<sup>2</sup> when I can get other people to fund it for me? Clearly, reasonable people would see the innumerable benefits of giving me money to buy a castle in Scotland. For one, they always say it’s better to give than to receive. And when they imagine the joy they’ll be responsible for, as I bask in the glory of my magnificent castle, they’ll be hard pressed to say no. And there’s got to be tax benefits for a donation like this<sup>3</sup>
Of course, for the stingier potential investors, I can also offer backer rewards. At an entry level donation, I’ll tag a brick with the backer’s name when I post photos on Facebook showing off my castle. Throw in a more sizeable donation, and I’ll actually get one of the bricks engraved with your name<sup>4</sup>.  Donate the big bucks, and I’ll let you visit my castle<sup>5</sup>.
If you’re interested in backing this project, please slip an envelope full of money into locker #240 on the third floor of MC<sup>6</sup>.
Thanks for the cash<sup>7</sup>,

<article><title>A statistically proven method to write a winning article using a data-driven model based on previous winning articles</title>
<content><strong>Abstract</strong>
The title <em>Article of the Issue</em> is a long sought after status quo that is a dream achievement for many hungry starved uWaterloo mathNEWS contributors. By developing a statistical approach to analyzing past submissions, this article shows how to assemble a winning article using a computational approach in Python of the most commonly used phrases and words, thereby allowing other writers to use a data-driven approach to having a higher probability of achieving <em>Article Of The Issue</em>.
<ol><li><strong>Methods</strong></li></ol>
The current and past term articles of the issue were selected by copying and pasting into a plain-text document from the posted PDF files found online on http://mathnews.uwaterloo.ca. This data was then parsed in Python, stripping out newlines and additional spaces. Twogram and threegram (Where an <em>ngram </em>is <em>n</em> words beside each other) were gathered, and the top fifty of each dataset were selected. By selecting out the most frequently occurring twogram and threegram, sentences could then be constructed to form a mostly cohesive sentence made from literary gold in the eyes of the MathNEWS editors.
<strong>2. Results</strong>
The existence of of a god. Some of the number of mines must be a University of Waterloo. The Cosmological Argument game-piece designs that the universe of information can be the most miracle that midiLength = a god. For some game would be nothing, Surely the gods must have a coming to campus at time t=0.
Surely the gods must be nothing.
<strong>3. Discussion</strong>
<em>3.1 Sources of error</em>
While the source of data was a digital form (PDFs), there are inherent issues with copying a formatted document into unformatted text. Small special characters such as non-breakable space characters cause MathNEWS to show up as a common ngram Math NEWS. Some words that are not on multiple lines showed up on multiple lines, which could cause some ngrams to be higher on the list. For an improved revision of this computational model’s input, as well as output, the raw unformatted text from the drafts should be considered as an improved input.
<em>3.2 Next steps</em>
With a larger input dataset and more funding and time for the researchers involved in this study, markov chains could be considered to further automate this process of generating quality content. However, due to time constraints, only the past term and the current term could be fetched and placed into the input dataset, resulting in a small set of ngrams, not enough for a good markov training dataset.

<article><title>ed(1) is Turing-Complete</title>
<content>Yet another tool has been added to our list of accidentally Turing-complete things. This time, it’s the venerable line editor, ed(1) (ed is the standard text editor).
Ed, the original Unix text editor, was written in the 1970s, back when teleprinters were the computer’s main interface. Unlike virtually all modern editors, it’s what’s called a line editor: you manipulate the file as lines through a command line interface instead of displaying a live copy of the text as you edit it. It enjoys only niche use today, but its influence has spread to many utilities, including sed, grep, vi and even perl.
If you aren’t familiar with ed and you decide to try it out yourself, your first session will probably look like this:<sup><sup>1</sup></sup>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>$ ed
help
?
h
Invalid command suffix
?
?
^C
?
exit
?
quit
?
^Z
$ killall ed
$ vi</code></pre>
</blockquote>
It isn’t a terribly friendly editor, but it was good enough to write Unix in. If you know your vi/vim commands, you’re already halfway there.
Despite its seemingly simple command set, ed was proven to be Turing-complete by implementing Rule 110, an elementary cellular automaton similar to Conway’s Game of Life that was shown to be capable of universal computation. This is the same device that was used to show that HTML+CSS3 is Turing-complete.
Here’s the script, licensed under the MIT by tPenguinLTG:<sup><sup>2</sup></sup>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>$a
.
-t.
.g/^\(.\).*\(.\)$/s//\2&amp;\1/
.g/^.$/s//&amp;&amp;&amp;/
s/./&amp;\
/g
d
?^$?+,$-2g/^/+,+2t.\
-2,.j\
s/111/0/\
s/110/1/\
s/101/1/\
s/100/0/\
s/011/1/\
s/010/1/\
s/001/1/\
s/000/0/
$-,$d
?^$?,$jp
w
!exec ed '%' &lt; '%'
q
# DATA
00000000000000000000000000000100
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
You’d run this by invoking <code>ed</code> on it to edit, as well as passing it in as input:
<blockquote>
<pre><code>$ ed rule110.ed &lt; rule110.ed</code></pre>
</blockquote>
It doesn’t terminate by itself, so you’ll have to manually kill it. The result of the simulation is written to the end of the file.
Long story short, the script implements each step of Rule 110 using a bunch of substitutions, and it achieves recursion by shelling out to call itself. Even better, the script passes data between recursive calls by modifying itself. Cheating? Maybe, but it works. A detailed walkthrough of the script and links to the GitHub repo can be found in tPenguinLTG’s blog post.<sup><sup>2</sup></sup>
As Reddit user meltingdiamond put it, “The most impressive part of this is somehow getting ed to do anything at all”.

<article><title>A Ransom Note to Die For</title>
<content>To  the course administrators of STAT 333, I have a message for you.
Last week, during our tutorial, I kept one of the dice provided for use in the game-based activity. I would like to apologize for this heinous act and return the die, but I thought of something much more devious to do instead.
Starting on the day of publication of this article, June 1st, 2018, I will roll the die once per day at midnight, and I will continue to do so until the day the ransom is paid. What ransom, you ask? $X, where X is the sum of all the die rolls up to the time of payment.
While you discuss your options and attempt to track me down, I would also like to take this opportunity to pose and answer the following question: what is the expected ransom payment?
Before I can begin, I have to lay out some assumptions:
<ul><li>The random variable N describes the number of days until the ransom is paid. I will assume it is a proper waiting time random variable, meaning that, eventually, the ransom will be paid.</li>
<li>The die is fair, so the die rolls for each day i = 1, 2, …, N will be discrete U<sub>i </sub>~ Uniform {1,…,6} random variables, mutually independent of each other.</li>
<li>The number of days it takes to pay the ransom is not affected by any of the die rolls individually (i.e. the variables are independent).</li></ul>
With these assumptions laid out, we can begin by looking at the following expectation, the expected value of X given that N is some possible value n.
E[X|N=n]
Substituting the definition of X, we get:
E[X|N=n] = E[U<sub>1</sub> + . . . + U<sub>N</sub>|N=n]
Now, since the value of N is set at n by the condition on our expectation, and because the U<sub>i</sub>’s are independent of N, we get this:
E[X|N=n] = E[U<sub>1</sub> + . . . + U<sub>n</sub>]
Finally, using the linear nature of expectation and the identical distributions of the die rolls, we have:
E[X|N=n] = E[U<sub>1</sub>] + . . . + E[U<sub>n</sub>] = nE[U<sub>1</sub>]
Since the mean value of a single die roll is 3.5, this results in a final value of 3.5n. However, this only tells us the expected ransom payment if we know that N = n. So, we need one more tool: double averaging. Feel free to try the proof on your own or look it up, but the result we are interested in here is, for two random variables Y and Z:
E[Y] = E[E[Y|Z]]
So in our example,
E[X] = E[E[X|N]] = E[3.5N]
Once again using the linear nature of expectation, we have:
E[X] = 3.5E[N]
So the final result we see is that the expected ransom payment is 3.5 times the expected number of days. If we assume that N follows a geometric distribution with probability of payment on any given day of 1/4, this would give us an expected ransom payment of $14 for the die, however any proper waiting time random variable would suffice.
I look forward to your response, course administrators of STAT 333. May the odds be ever in your favour.

<article><title>I&#39;m writing an article about a proof assistant</title>
<content><strong>Alternative title: Only 109* people will understand this article but I want pizza</strong>
First year math students typically take three mandatory courses in their 1A term: MATH135, MATH137, and CS115/135. Each of these courses runs an advanced section, MATH145, MATH147, and CS145 respectively. Certain mathematically gifted students elect to take these courses. A number of other students, for whatever strange reason, also elect to take these courses despite their lack of extraordinary math ability. I fall into the latter category, and now find myself one of two situations at all times — I am either:
<ol><li>Working on the MATH145 assignment, or</li>
<li>Thinking about the MATH145 assignment.</li></ol>
This year, there are actually two sections for each of the advanced math courses, taught by two different profs. Professor David Jao, who teaches one of the MATH145 sections, is using a software tool called Coq (pronounced Coke) to teach his class this year. Coq allows the formal expression of mathematical definitions and theorems and the proofs for those theorems, and, relevant to MATH145, forces its users to write extremely rigorous proofs. The assignments for this section of MATH145 heavily involve the use of Coq, and since, as previously stated, I am always either working on the assignment or thinking about the assignment, it has affected the scope of what I think about day to day.
So of course, in writing this article, I really could not come up with anything better to write about. Or anything else to write about at all, for that matter. Sorry.
Coq is a software tool used to for a variety of purposes including the certification of properties of programming languages, the formalization of mathematics, and teaching. The development of Coq began in 1984, supported by a whole slew of French universities and research institutes, and its initial release was in May of 1989. Today, it is used for many purposes and specifically as an educational tool in math and computer science. It is used internationally in many countries including France, Sweden, the US, Canada, Poland, the Netherlands, and South Korea.
The word <em>“coq”</em> means rooster in French. Apparently it is common practice to name research tools after animals in France. Coq was actually initially named CoC, after Calculus of Constructions, the typed** programming language that was implemented by Coq in its earliest days. In 1991, the name was changed from CoC to Coq, reflecting the new implementation of the extended Calculus of Inductive Constructions (also a typed programming language). The name Coq is also a reference to Thierry Coquand, a professor of computer science in Sweden who helped develop Calculus of Constructions and Calculus of Inductive Constructions.
There is quite an active online community surrounding Coq. Coq has a mailing list (though I haven’t quite figured out what exactly is sent through that mailing list — perhaps now is the time to engage in some investigative journalism), an active subreddit (r/Coq), and is frequently discussed on Stack Overflow and Stack Exchange. Coq is also on Github where users report bugs and help fix issues, and the repository has over 100 contributors.
At this point I think I’ve exhausted all the information I could find and understand about Coq, which means it’s time for me to stop writing about Coq and return to actually using it to (hopefully) finish this assignment. I hope this article was educational to those wondering why some of the MATH145 kids are programming, and entertaining for those of us suffering*** through it.

** If you were actually interested: typed here does not mean typing on a computer. Typed refers to type theory, a  mathematically defined system in which every term has a type and operations are restricted to terms of a certain type.
*** I kid! I love Coq, and I love this class. I am most definitely suffering though (help me).</content></article>
<article><title>What if all humans pissed at the same time and place?</title>
<content><em>Because Randall Munroe hasn’t answered this question yet.</em>
First off, I don’t know what kind of scenario would require all of humanity taking a piss at the same time. Aside from the minutes before a species-wide road trip, there’s really no reason to consider this ever happening. Really, there isn’t.
But this is <em>math</em><strong>NEWS</strong>, so we’ll consider it anyways.
There’s a lot of Google results about “what if all humans pissed at once” <sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>. Most of them come to the same boring conclusion: nothing would happen, because sewers are a thing. Furthermore, outside of “what if everyone pissed into the ocean”, I have been unable to find any articles on the effects of all of humankind simultaneously excreting the contents of their bladders in the same place. But because this is a news article, dramatization and hyperbole is necessary to answer the given question — such resources won’t do. Instead, let’s get our hands dirty, and dive into what would happen if the human population actually ended up in the same geographical location with full bladders, and simultaneously went to the toilet.
The first issue we’re faced with is something that Randall Munroe, who is the actual creator of what if? (and thus the inspiration behind the entire article), managed to solve: how much space would you need to fit the entire population of the Earth? We can safely assume that we are looking at only the living portion of all humans, and not the deceased nor undead<sup>3</sup>. A crowd of all 7.7 billion living humans would be be slightly bigger than Rhode Island<sup>4</sup>, or 55.5% of PEI<sup>5</sup>. Not bad. In fact, just to make everyone a bit more comfortable, we’ll arrange for everyone to be in PEI instead of Rhode Island, and centralize the crowd around Glen Valley, its highest point. A lot roomier, and the food is probably better! There’s probably even room for some privacy guards.
For the actual pissing portion, an examination of what kind of biblically-proportioned flood might result would be useful. The closest internet source I could find regarding this was a surprisingly accurate Yahoo Answers post from eight years ago<sup>6</sup>, which states that the combined volume of urine would be 2,070,000,000 litres, or enough to fill only 828 Olympic-sized swimming pools. Unfortunately, the estimated bladder size in the answer is for normal capacity, not maximum, so for the purposes of this article it completely misses the mark. Add in the hundreds of millions of people that have been born between 2010 and 2018, and it becomes clear that this is a piss-poor estimate.
So, back to basics. Depending on which textbook you trust, a healthy adult human bladder has a maximum capacity of anywhere from 470 millilitres to a full litre<sup>7</sup><sup>8</sup>. Of course, not everyone’s bladder will be big enough to hold a full saucepan’s worth of urine, so we’ll assume an average maximum of 700 mL. Maybe a bit on the liberal side considering the child populace, but it sounds about right. We can now calculate the new combined volume:
<link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/What_if_al_08908bb75aeb497ba9c97c80b4f515a76bbe9350.pdf"></link>
That’s equivalent to 2156 Olympic-sized <del>swimming</del> pissing pools. Determining how long it would take to swim a lap in each pisscine is left as a mental exercise to the reader.
Regardless, 5,390,000,000 litres is a crapload of piss to be talking about. In particular, that means supplying at least 5,390,000,000 litres of water to everyone right before the pee-scheduled urination time. Aside from the logistical nightmare of finding a place to store that much water, there’s also the slightly smaller issue of where to procure five billion litres of freshwater. You’re looking at shipping over New York City’s daily water consumption<sup>9</sup> to a tiny island in Atlantic Canada, and that’s just the lower bound. If it’s a particularly hot day, that number is going way up. And if our supply chain is inefficient, people could be left holding their pee in for hours, resulting in possibly the loudest chorus of “Can I use the toilet?” ever heard. It actually turns out that water supply is the least of our problems, but we’ll get to that part later.
Now that we’ve set up everyone, we can commence our scenario<sup>10</sup>. At the signal, 7.7 billion humans begin relieving themselves. Spread out, they don’t do <em>too</em> much damage. The human urinary flow rate is small enough that the loose, loamy soil absorbs most of the initial onslaught before saturating and turning into mud. PEI also produces more potatoes than it produces asparagus, so the initial pee smell isn’t too bad for one. Geographically, where elevation is higher, damage is limited to a few new creeks and washouts. The most damage would be seen close to the coast and major watersheds, where elevation is lowest. There, streams of urine combine to erode the soil to the bedrock, while also washing away a few thousand participants. Vast, bare wastelands of piss-contaminated mud replace towns and villages, and the few structures that do remain standing are completely inaccessible by land. Environmentally, watersheds that aren’t already destroyed by the mudflows become heavily eutrophic, and within a few days the resulting algae blooms kill off all aquatic animal life, resulting in a stench that overhangs the island for days. But as always, it could be worse.
Now, I could call it a day here. It’s pretty darn late, I pulled an all-nighter yesterday, and another one today isn’t going to do me any good.  Except we still haven’t <em>quite</em> answered the given question. After all, ambiguity begets questions like “what if everyone just peed on the same spot of earth at the same time? How would that happen?”
Answer: If you thought our problems before were bad, just wait.
In order to get 7.7 billion people to aim at the same spot of earth, we need to spread everyone out vertically instead of horizontally. This means building very tall structures, and that’s where we hit our first problem. For optimal efficiency, we make our target circular<sup>11</sup>, and just for simplicity’s sake we’ll assume a circle of radius one metre — small enough to count as a single spot of earth compared to the numbers we’re dealing with, but big enough that hopefully no one will miss. From experience, 14 people can make a circle with radius a bit more than 1 m,  so we’ll be stacking everyone up in levels of 14. Already, this is beginning to look like a stupendously tall structure, so just to lessen the pressure on our poor engineers we’ll stagger the levels so that a new one begins every half-human-height, thus halving the height of our Tower of Piss. The average height of a human is 1.65 metres, so if we order people across levels by height, we get an average of 0.825 metres of spacing between levels. That leads to a height of….drumroll…
<link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/What_if_al_6d248d4960cd9d12b2484295ff28fc3eb8b07f7b.pdf"></link>
In other words, only 1.2 times the distance between the Moon and the Earth. Yep, completely doable.
Erecting such a structure on solid ground would require some serious engineering. Erecting such a structure on PEI, where the underlying bedrock is a “soft red sandstone"<sup>12</sup>, is even harder. You’d have to do some serious load balancing in order to not overload the bedrock, and even then, that sandstone would be very close to failure.
But with the help of some overworked graduate students, we managed to overcome both the engineering issues and the issue of colliding with the Moon. We now have a structure taller than any ever built, so tall that 99.999996% of its occupants would have to wear pressure suits in order to survive<sup>13</sup>. It’s also so tall that we need some sort of urine collection mechanism for the upper storeys, for comfort and so that the stream stays liquid all the way down. A dreadfully expensive cost, but since we already went with the hassle of moving everyone here and actually building this thing, we’ll do it anyways and fund it out of UofT’s budget.
To recap, we’ve erected a giant tower, loaded everyone onto it, and hammered in some expensive equipment to make sure we have a laminar stream of piss coming all the way down. Splashback and misting issues aside, this actually seems feasible. We do have to start the topmost storeys early to make sure that everyone’s piss hits the ground at the same time, but that’s pretty much a non-issue at this point. With that being said, let us commence the operation.
At T-9618s, the top most storey is given the signal to start pissing.
At T-6801s, 50% of the world’s population have relieved themselves.
At T-4809s, 75% of the world’s population have emptied their bladders.
At T-1s, a bit less than 5,390,000,000 litres of urine hangs five metres above the ground. I don’t know what velocity it’s achieved at this point, but it’s definitely towards the right side of the interval [0, I-don’t-even-want-to-think-about-it).
At T-0.5s, the mass of urine sits 1.2 metres above ground. A dark yellow shadow hangs over the land, an ominous warning of what is yet to come.
At T-0.1s, the mass of urine is five centimetres away from touching the soft, loamy soil of Prince Edward Island. It is moving so fast that the air beneath it is being pushed out at supersonic speeds, scouring the ground surface and killing everyone on the first level.  Thankfully, our grad students did their jobs, and despite the enormous force on its structure, the tower stands.
At T-0s, impact occurs.
It is at this point that we take a short, but relevant, diversion. Back in 2013, a group of physicists at Georgia Tech discovered that, on average, mammals urinate for 21 seconds with a standard deviation of 13 seconds<sup>14</sup><sup>15</sup>. As humans are mammals [citation needed], we’ll assume that everyone in our scenario pisses for an average of 34 seconds, since full bladders are involved. With 5,390,000,000 litres of urine being involved, this yields an average flow rate that is a staggering <em>158,529,411.8 litres per second</em>. For those of you keeping track at home, that’s equivalent to over 27 Niagara Falls.
Against 27 Niagara Falls’ worth of water crashing down at God-knows-what-number metres per second, the soil underneath our target doesn’t stand a chance. The stream obliterates the topsoil layer, throwing up a giant geyser of mud and sand and choking everyone on the lower levels. In less than a second, it hits the bedrock. Already at its breaking point, the sandstone catastrophically fails, compromising the foundation and nullifying the efforts of our trusty grad students. Meanwhile, a gigantic debris flow begins snaking its way from the remains of Glen Valley towards the relative calm of the Atlantic Ocean, destroying everything in its path. Within seconds, our tower begins to fall.
453,750 kilometres above the Earth’s surface, in the confines of space, a judder is felt, and the tip of the tower begins to accelerate in the direction of the Moon. Alarmed, the occupants try to escape, but to no avail: as the structure disintegrates, all escape routes are cut off, and with everyone on the lower levels either dead or dying, there’s no one to save them once they hit the ground.
At T+34 s, humanity has finally emptied the collective might of its bladders onto the Earth’s surface. Massive debris flows crisscross the landscape,  and where Glen Valley once stood, there now exists a pit full of piss.  Debris from the initial impact and pieces of the disintegrating tower rain down from above, scarring the newly-exposed bedrock and leaving their mark on what used to be Prince Edward Island.
Meanwhile, the tip of the tower continues to accelerate towards the surface of the Moon, despite the best efforts of its pissed-off inhabitants. When they inevitably meet, it’s at an almost unimaginable impact velocity of 1,023 metres per second. The collision shatters the structure, littering the already pockmarked surface with even more craters, and creating humanity’s first (and only) lunar cemetery. It’s a gruesome end.
But hey, at least everyone got to use the toilet.

<article><title>Why does the head of CECA make so much money when all CECA does is fuck over students?</title>

Of course, nearly all co-op students believe that CECA is not there to help students (try searching for CECA on /r/uwaterloo), and indeed sometimes stands in the way of students achieving their goals. So, Feridun, what does Ross Johnston do in one year that’s worth $177,472.52? Convince us, the student body, that our tuition and fees are being properly spent.
The purpose of a university is academic progress. While employer relations may be important, why does Ross Johnston make more money than some professors here, when professors actually give students the skills needed to succeed in the workplace? You might (if you aren’t a student) argue that CECA helps students prepare for work through their PD courses. But if you talk to anyone who’s actually gone through the PD courses and has a few co-op terms on their belt, they’ll all tell you the same thing: whatever PD says to do, do the opposite.
It’s time that the University of Waterloo takes a long look at how money is being spent at CECA, and on the co-op system in general.

<article><title>Ranking F 2018 / W 2019 14X professor by their fan bases</title>
<content>Note: this article is not meant to imply that any of these professors are better than any other. It’s simply examining the size and quality of the fan bases of each of the professors. Of the professors in this article I have had, they were all great. Of the ones I haven’t had, I have only heard great things.
<strong>6. Ken Davidson</strong>
Ken Davidson is a wonderful prof who you will learn a lot from, but has nevertheless failed to receive a large fan base, although I do have one friend who says “I connect with Ken on a spiritual level”. As far as we know, Davidson lacks a fan page.
<strong>5. Laurent Marcoux</strong>
Marcoux has learned from Davidson, his PhD advisor, and has taken steps to develop a very large fan base. Everybody who has taken a course with Marcoux loves him. However, his fan base is not as committed as the fan bases of some other professors. As far as we know, Marcoux lacks a fan page.
<strong>4. Ross Willard</strong>
Ross Willard is fantastic. My friend, a 18 year-old girl says she wants to be like Ross Willard when she grows up. Not many old white guys are inspiring enough to make young girls want to be like them. Unfortunately, as far as we know, Willard lacks a fan page. However, his fans do have a nickname: Willard’s Dogs.
<strong>3. David McKinnon</strong>
David McKinnon is loved by his students and stories about him make him sound 50 years younger than he looks. He must be a very energetic guy. He uses ♣ instead of ∎ to finish his proofs, which is pretty cool. McKinnon had a fan page, but unfortunately it seems to have gone offline recently. We ask the CSC to put  his fan page, which was hosted at <a href="http://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/~fbauckho/">csclub.uwaterloo.ca/~fbauckho/</a> back online permanently.
<strong>2. Stephen New</strong>
Stephen New, affectionately known as “snew” and “Pastor Snew” after terrifiED called him that while in a panicked state before his midterm, is widely loved by students. He has an active fan page at <a href="https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jj6yu/">student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jj6yu/</a> which contains beautiful pictures of him. He also organizes math contests and helps students prepare for them.
<strong>1. David Jao</strong>
David Jao, affectionately known as “Daddy Jao” for his paternalistic qualities is widely adored by undergraduate and graduate students alike. His curves are legendary. Ken Davidson is known to have said that he doesn’t know anyone who curves like Professor Jao. Legend has it that Professor Willard was once late to our MATH 146 lecture because he was accosted by Professor Jao (or as Willard says, Professor Jaaaaaaaoooo) in the hallway. Daddy Jao is also famous for the wonderful life advice he gives out on Reddit, Piazza, and in office hours. Daddy Jao has an active fan page at <a href="https://daddyjao.com/">daddyjao.com</a> which is also mirrored at <a href="https://daddyjao.gitlab.io/">daddyjao.gitlab.io/</a> in case the .com domain ever expires.

<content><em>When I posted my first novel excerpt, I wanted to title it “The First N Words of the Story (on which) I’m working (on)” to make a funny grammar joke.

We all know these errors occur when a recursive function doesn’t terminate in time (and we know it’s because recursive function calls continually eat up stack space (at least until the program runs out of memory (which is the risk of writing recursive functions (even if they’re tail-recursive)))). A computer doesn’t have infinite memory, but recursion is the infinite (the never-ending). A recursive function is a hungry, insatiable beast (it devours memory, forever, without stopping (at least not until we pacify it with an exit condition)).
Make a Google search for the word “recursion” and you’ll get this tongue-in-cheek response:
<pre><code>Did you mean: recursion.</code></pre>
You can click on this link (but it only takes you back to this very page (where you can click on it again and again (initiating another recursive program capable of running forever (at least until it hits the exit condition (you get bored) or runs out of memory (you fall asleep))))).
But recursion is not unique to computer science or mathematics (it’s also often seen in art (with pictures and paintings of people holding pictures of themselves (this is called the Droste effect and I’m sure you’ve seen it (but if you haven’t, look at The Laughing Cow next time you go grocery shopping)) and Matroyshka Dolls (nesting dolls that contain smaller versions of themselves (with the smaller dolls being younger than the larger ones)) and infinity mirrors (two mirrors facing each other (which uses infinite reflection to create the illusion of a large landscape populated with infinite copies of some people or objects (placed between the two mirrors)))). Even before the notion of computers, we’ve been infatuated with this special kind of the infinite.
It is unlike the infinity that looks outwards (like when you stare up at the night sky (and wonder how many stars there are (and how many of them are larger than the sun (and just how big is the universe, really?))) and spills and spreads, permeating everywhere, distinguishable nowhere, and demands answers from that mind-boggling vastness, busyness of itself (like the Fermi paradox (which relies on statistical inevitabilities (based on this infinity that promises us unending combinations of chemical soup))). Recursion’s infinity is self-similar (it looks inwards (curling and folding in on itself (containing itself))). When I think of the infinity of largeness (of unboundedness (of the everything)), it shadows me. But I could hold the infinity of recursion in just one hand. See:
<link alt="Image result for apollonian gasket" class="irc_mi" height="220" href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/img/Recursion_220px-ApollonianGasket-15_32_32_33.svg.png" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/ApollonianGasket-15_32_32_33.svg/220px-ApollonianGasket-15_32_32_33.svg.png" width="220"/>
That infinity of everything is fearsome because it is the unknown. Comparatively, recursion’s infinity is seemingly innocuous (it is infinite in a rather familiar sense, after all (since every part of it is already known from the beginning)). It is easy to dismiss. But it is very much an infinity as any other kind, and just as dangerous. Forget the exit condition in your recursive function and the overlooked monster rears its head again, threatening to escape beyond your computer (only stopping because you only have a finite amount of stack space). Its ugly power is in ignorance (because it does not know any better (and so it does not know when to stop (every iteration looks like the previous (so there’s nothing to do but keep going (and going (and going)))))).
Let’s go back to Google and that recursive link (which transformed into a recursive program with the addition of you (whose exit condition was tedium (and the program would run out of memory upon your death (this means that the program could potentially run for 80 years (on American average))))). Because this is an extended metaphor, I’m also going back to the proposed title of my novel excerpt, which looked like a bunch of nested S-expressions (and just look at these parentheticals that I’m using as rhetoric (doesn’t it just look like some cute little Racket code? (and that one was a predicate))). Writing is hard because I keep going on these tangents (and that’s just how we think (every thought keeps leading to another (in a way alike to these parentheticals))). Parsing that title was so hard because I couldn’t keep track of the previous layers (and likewise, forming a coherent argument is pretty hard because I can’t keep track of my train of thought).
Speaking of Racket, here’s our favourite recursive function:
<pre><code>(<mathnews--code-strong>define</mathnews--code-strong> (factorial n)
  (<mathnews--code-strong>if</mathnews--code-strong> (= n 0)
      1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1))))</code></pre>
When DrRacket is at <code>(factorial 3)</code> it cannot tell if that was the beginning of the recursive chain, or if it’s part of another call to the function, say <code>(factorial 6)</code>. If I let my mind wander, I start going down parentheticals again (and this is often called a thought spiral (but I would say it’s more like a dense S-expression of thoughts (nested like the DrRacket stepper trying to evaluate a naive Fibonacci function (and also like the DrRacket stepper, I never know which thoughts (if any) preceded this one)))). All I know is that this thought leads to that one (and so I should probably keep going there (I see no reason to stop)). I could keep going until I ran out of memory and died (but realistically, sleep is a sufficient way of artificially limiting stack space).
My favourite thing to look at is the sky. I love how deep it is. I love how I feel like I’m falling towards it when I look up. The sky is limitless, it is that infinity again, the one that terrifies and inspires us with possibilities. But these days I am always looking inwards at this other infinity, the one that curls and twists up inside of me, all inside a conveniently and deceivingly small space, and I never know it.</content></article>
<article><title>Gratitude</title>
<content><h1> <span style="font-weight: 400;">What is Gratitude?</span></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Google says, “Gratitude, thankfulness, or gratefulness, from the Latin word <em>gratus</em> ‘pleasing, thankful’, is a feeling of appreciation felt by and/or similar positive response shown by the recipient of kindness, gifts, help, favors, or other types of generosity, towards the giver of such gifts.”</span>
In layman’s terms: “Gratitude is an emotion expressing appreciation for what one has — as opposed to, for instance, a consumer-driven emphasis on what one wants or thinks they need.”
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benefits of Gratitude</span></h1>
In positive psychology research, gratitude is strongly and consistently associated with greater happiness. Gratitude helps people feel more positive emotions, relish good experiences, improve their health, deal with adversity, and build strong relationships.
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why bother?</span></h1>
Maybe because the alternative is pessimism and pessimism can often turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy. Most humans in the 21st century tend to be pessimistic because they see it all around them — you check your phone after waking up in the morning, and the first thing you see is a Facebook rant on how unfortunate life is, or yet another “Why I left Buzzfeed?” video.
When we see such things, our mindset tends to wire itself to think in such ways. In other words, we see what we look for. When things do not go the way we want them to, we often feel disappointed and tend to blame others. This tendency to externalize blame can often work against you. Rather than thinking what someone else conspired to bring your downfall, think what you can do to avoid such pitfalls in the future. As one Waterloo alumni spoke regarding failure:
<blockquote><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The cost of failure is a lesson. The lesson is repeated until it is  learned.”</span></blockquote>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ways  to incorporate Gratitude into your life</span></h1>
<ol><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><i>Keep a gratitude journal. </i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Ryan Holiday (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">my favorite author) </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">said in many of his </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">writings,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> start your day by journaling. You might say, “you expect me to find time before my 8:30 class to fucking write?” I thought exactly the same when I first read up on this, but it can be very simple and rewarding. After waking up, simply write down one thing you are grateful for. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b><i>Thank someone mentally.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> No time to write? It may help to just think of how someone has helped you or made your day better.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><b>Visualize.</b><b style="font-weight: 400;"> </b></i>This may sound a bit extreme, but imagine someone you deeply love dying. This practice is very disturbing and rightfully so. It is designed to help you feel grateful for that individual’s presence in your life. If you want to take this to the next level, call them up, tell them what they mean to you, and that you love them. This will make both your days much better.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b><i>Start slow.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> One habit that has personally helped me is not checking social media for the first hour after waking up. I feel this gives me time to wake up naturally, rather than being bombarded by notifications about other people’s lives which don’t impact me in any way. This also feeds into the first point about journaling; rather than starting your day by checking social media, you could spend that time on yourself.</span></li></ol></ol>
If you are still reading this, I hope I have been able to provide you with at least one idea to cultivate gratitude in your life. This was my first article for mathNEWS; hopefully they’ll progressively get better. See you in two weeks.

<article><title>6 reasons why you should transfer to Arts</title>
<content>Hello! Did you know that you don’t have to be part of the math faculty to write for mathNEWS?? Me neither. Until now.
Yes, I am from the Faculty of Arts. Majoring in Peace and Conflict Studies and minoring in Sexuality, Marriage and Family Studies. It’s quite the mouthful, but dreadfully interesting. So why am I here? Well, obviously because mathNEWS is the best publication on campus and I wanted to contribute. Hopefully, I can hit mathNEWS with a fresh perspective as I imagine there are not many of us arts students sharing our point of view here. Although the Faculty of Arts here at UWaterloo has some major downsides, I do believe that it is the best place to spend your undergrad. Rest assured, I will come here during the term to address and complain about some of those downsides, but not before I make one valiant attempt to convince you that you should transfer into Arts (or at least appreciate it for the best faculty).
<h2>1. No class on Fridays</h2>
Seriously, I don’t know any Arts students who have class on Friday. I’m not sure if it’s because we don’t have labs and tutorials,  or what, but this is no lie. By the way, the lack of labs and tutorials is another plus because it means with a full course load, you’ll never have more than 15 hours of class per week — the dream.
<h2>2. Never have classes in the prison that is MC again*</h2>
Although the arts lecture hall is actually one of the shittiest buildings on campus, it’s not like all our classes are there. In fact, I’m in third year and I’ve only had 2 lectures there. A math student told me that all math classes take place in MC, so that’s rough.** I don’t need to tell you that it’s like a prison in here. (Although I will admit that these new computer labs where mathNEWS meetings are held are pretty fresh.)
*this is not 100% true because I had a first-year political science class here.
**I’m trusting the math student, so don’t get angry if it’s not true.
<h2>3. Skip class and still pass</h2>
I almost called this point “don’t try and still pass”, but then I thought that writing 15–20 page essays (which is standard for upper-year courses) definitely counts as trying, and when you have multiple of those suckers in a semester it actually gets pretty legit. But I can confirm that Arts has the most skippable classes across all faculties. This is because you don’t always need to attend class to be able to write a bangin’ final essay (because it’s often an independent research essay and only needs to involve the actual course content very loosely).  So, as the term goes on, those 15 hours of class a week become…less…
<h2>4. Get a fancy program name (sounds impressive)</h2>
Majoring in Pure Math? No one even knows what that is. Isn’t all math pure math? Just kidding,  y’all probably know what pure math is because you’re in math. As I’m writing this though, it’s becoming a moot point because wtf is even peace and conflict studies. I can’t even count the number of times people look at me and then say politely, “and what do you want to do with that?” Ugh. Let’s move on.
<h2>5. Everyone is getting laid.</h2>
It’s a well-known fact. Related: people are sociable and like to talk to each other.
<h2>6. You can still write for mathNEWS</h2>
So you don’t have to give up your favourite thing about the math faculty and free pizza every other week.
There is no loss here.

<article><title>👏👏 Flag Review 4: The Fourth Flag Review</title>
<content>Flag Review 👏👏
Last mathNEWS production night, I asked the people working on mathNEWS which flags I should review this time around. I got a lot of suggestions, some of which were …controversial, some of which were too cliché, some of which were very meme-y, and a very rare few which were actually good suggestions. Thus, this time I will be reviewing some municipal flags of Canada.
Here is my rubric, like always:
The flags will be scored out of 10, with 5 of those being my holistic subjective score, and the other 5 being based on each of the 5 basic principles of flag design as defined by the North American Vexillological Association (NAVA). They are:
<ul><li>Keep it simple</li>
<li>Use meaningful symbolism</li>
<li>Use two or three basic colours</li>
<li>No lettering or seals</li>
<li>Be distinctive or be related</li></ul>
Flag of Toronto
<link alt="Flag of Toronto, Canada.svg" href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/img/_Flag_Re_1280px-Flag_of_Toronto%2C_Canada.svg.png" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Flag_of_Toronto%2C_Canada.svg/1280px-Flag_of_Toronto%2C_Canada.svg.png"/>
The City of Toronto flag does what it needs to do in a very simple yet distinct way. For those that do not know what the Toronto City Hall buildings look like, it consists of two tall curved buildings on either side of a circular Council Chamber building. The white coloured portion of the flag encapsulates that iconic image, and adds a new meaning to it: The horizontal curved portion added to the shape of the two vertical lines makes it appear like the letter T, meaning Toronto. It is a great design choice to make. The only fault I see with the design of this flag is the maple leaf at the base of the T. This flag does very well in its municipal symbolism and design, but the addition of the maple leaf appears out of place. It is a national symbol, and not a municipal one. It is not distinctive nor representative of Toronto specifically. If the maple leaf must be included in the flag to symbolize a national connection of sorts, it would have been better suited to have been placed centrally on the flag rather than at the base of the T. The flag without the maple leaf would have still perfectly suited the City of Toronto, with its simple design, but even with the maple leaf, it still makes a great flag.
Design Score: ★★★★☆
Subjective Score: ★★★★☆
Flag of Montreal
<link alt="Flag of Montreal.svg" href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/img/_Flag_Re_1280px-Flag_of_Montreal.svg.png" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Flag_of_Montreal.svg/1280px-Flag_of_Montreal.svg.png"/>
The flag of Montreal shows right away what its connections are. The English and French origins are clearly seen from the flag. It uses a variant of the St. George’s Cross seen on the flag of England, only with a circular portion in the centre, on a design similar to the flag of Quebec with its fleurs-de-lis. Although, instead of purely just fleurs-de-lis, this instead uses British and Irish symbols as well. We’ll get to the central symbol after. Starting in the first quadrant going clockwise, we see the Red Rose of Lancaster (not the Tudor Rose) representing the English, the Shamrock representing the Irish, the Thistle representing the Scottish, and the Fleur-de-lis representing the French. Despite being in Québec, considering that there were no distinct French symbols before 1939, I guess it is worth mentioning that 1/5 of the symbols being French (previously 1/4 of the symbols) is better than none. The fifth and final symbol is the white pine, added to the flag in 2017, representing the First Nations Indigenous peoples. Considering their continuous presence in what is now Canada for thousands of years before colonialism, it is great to see their representation on a municipal flag. You don’t really see much representation in other municipal flags. It is a welcome sign that Montreal added theirs without ruining or over-complicating the design of the flag. Let’s hope they don’t need to add a sixth symbol anytime soon. Any more and the flag will become too cluttered with symbols everywhere. Overall, it is a great flag, deep in symbolism and historical connection, which perfectly suits the city of Montreal and its inhabitants.
Design Score: ★★★☆☆
Subjective Score: ★★★★☆
Flag of Vancouver
<img alt="Flag of Vancouver (Canada).svg" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Flag_of_Vancouver_%28Canada%29.svg/1280px-Flag_of_Vancouver_%28Canada%29.svg.png"/>
The general shape of the flag of Vancouver is quite similar to what a lot of flags tend to look like; there is a triangular shape on the left with some design on the remaining portion of the flag. Some flags, like South Africa’s, use the design very well. Some, like this one here, don’t do it as well. Starting with the better portion of the flag, we see the blue wavy lines across a field of white. Vancouver being a port city, surrounded on three sides by water, just tucked away from the Pacific Ocean by the Salish Sea, it is clear that the blue waves symbolise the city’s connection to them, and justifiably so. You don’t really get to see any wavy bars across flags often. It makes this flag stand out. On the hoist side of the flag, the green pentagon represents the forests which used to cover the city. Vancouver is quite known as a Green City so it still fits in well even if most of the forests are now gone. Finally we get to the last element on the flag: the yellow badge. I’ve said it before; such fine detail is not visible from a far distance, and it makes the flag unnecessarily more complicated than it needs to be. Instead, Vancouver should do what is seen on the flag of Toronto. Perhaps the triangular part of the green pentagon should have a yellow border on it. This would make the flag have a sideways letter V for Vancouver on the flag. This is definitely a missed opportunity. Toronto can’t be the only big city to have its own initials on its flag. It’s unfortunate that the city chose to put their city badge on the flag instead.
Design Score: ★★★☆☆
Subjective Score: ★★★☆☆
BONUS FLAG: Flag of Waterloo
<link alt="Image result for city of waterloo flag" href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/img/_Flag_Re_hqdefault.jpg" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uFZci9ZrOK0/hqdefault.jpg"/>
(Note to editor, please remove the black bars from the image of this flag. I do not know how to do that myself. This image was just found off of Google and it came with the black bars. Thank you.)
I have never seen Waterloo’s flag, but the City of Waterloo website says that the “crest … comprises Waterloo’s official flag.” I take this to mean that Waterloo’s flag is the crest on a white background. Considering the city motto is “Stability” the flag sends the wrong message as it looks more chaotic than stable. Who decided this was a good idea? Can we please get City Council to seriously think and contemplate the grave error of their ways? This needs to be fixed. Even Cambridge’s flag looks better than Waterloo’s, and have you seen the flag of Cambridge? I guess I should start with the colours. I don’t even know if using only two colours, or not using any other colours at all is a better choice. The pure block of black details on yellow is just hard to look at. So, in this case, keeping it limited to two colours did not help at all. Would anyone even be able to discern or tell apart all the details when the flag is hoisted? Obviously not. The detailed designs of a city’s seal is meant to be seen on papers and documents, not on a flag. Furthermore, the fact that it needs to say “City of Waterloo Ontario” defeats the purpose of a flag, which is representing without the need to write out what it is that it’s representing! Until Waterloo gets a better flag, it’s best not to use this flag at all. F.
Design Score: ☆☆☆☆☆
Subjective Score: ☆☆☆☆☆
As always, you’re free to submit flags to the mathNEWS email if you wish to see them reviewed. Make your own flag and submit it if you want to. You have plenty of time to do so, since the next issue isn’t until the beginning of the next term.

<article><title>Stairway Constants, part [0,1)</title>
<content>In the W19 term, a number line was added to the north-northeast stairwell in MC (the one near the DC and M3 bridges), putting CC’s 2018 review of vertical transportation mechanisms in MC out of date. Well, things haven’t changed that much. If anything, the number line has only further solidified the stairwell’s position as the nicest one in MC. Perhaps now it is also the most educational stairwell in UW.
But is it really educational, or just an expensive spiral of black paint? What can we learn from this piece of art (and the wealth of mathematical knowledge on the Internet)? I invite you out for a walk: MC north-northeast stairwell, basement level. Bring this article with you.
<h3>Floor 0</h3>
“This place exists?” Of course there’s a Floor 0. What kind of heretics would start their number line at 1? You look around, and there’s not much down here other than a really loud pipe and a door you’re not allowed to open. It’s as if this landing exists solely to host the start of the number line.
To the left of the big pink 0, the black number line gives you a taste of the negative numbers, until it runs into the wall around -0.2. (You remark that they could have fit -1/12 in there, and wonder why they didn’t.)
Slightly to the right of the big pink 0 is a silvery plaque:
<link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_f197a769d73713aef25da0891cc90833e3d3731c.pdf"></link>
<em><strong>arbitrarily small positive number</strong></em>
After taking calculus, the response is automatic: there exists a positive <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_e1bc2428d1722784d6e55a41d6b22f72b1fb7f23.pdf"></link> which is sufficiently small to guarantee that something else is less than <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_f197a769d73713aef25da0891cc90833e3d3731c.pdf"></link>. In that sense, <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_e1bc2428d1722784d6e55a41d6b22f72b1fb7f23.pdf"></link> is also an arbitrarily small positive number, but disappointingly, they seem to have left it out.
Or maybe it’s just a bit further along. You turn right and begin to follow the line. The tick marks count up by the hundredths, and you count 11 before you get to the next number. Unfortunately, it’s not <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_e1bc2428d1722784d6e55a41d6b22f72b1fb7f23.pdf"></link>.

<em><strong>Liouville’s constant</strong></em>
<em><strong> 0.11000100000…</strong></em>
(For more digits, see OEIS A012245.) Joseph Liouville was a 19th century French mathematician, known for proving the existence of transcendental numbers. The proof goes like this:
<ol><li>Lemma: Liouville numbers exist.</li>
<li>Lemma: all Liouville numbers are transcendental.</li>
<li>Profit.</li></ol>
A transcendental number is a number that is not the root of any polynomial with integer coefficients. Transcendental numbers are some of the most interesting numbers, and include superstars like <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_5e64510b5979c4326ac06b0670989041115b95d7.pdf"></link>, <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_ab6ccf699bb92a32d76c95cb54f5ae6d0fe5dd97.pdf"></link>, and <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_9c3385d3351783924cbb670ee56fbd061c0406c3.pdf"></link>.
But what are these magical Liouville numbers? To discuss them, we need a concept of approximation for real numbers. Take Liouville’s constant (<link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_beadc084773dc727b95854dcc1667b5893e6c095.pdf"></link>), for example. One way to approximate <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_beadc084773dc727b95854dcc1667b5893e6c095.pdf"></link> is with a sequence of rational numbers that converges to it. For a first attempt, let the <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_ab9c3c8c3b0d080190187f2c2a5f20ce04acacad.pdf"></link>th term be the closest rational number that has the denominator <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_ab9c3c8c3b0d080190187f2c2a5f20ce04acacad.pdf"></link>.
<link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_ae1f0a4f3bcd74a66e24a62c6db09cfac01a93fd.pdf"></link>
At most, we’re off by <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_30543e37fa367ad18abf2f4008bedacb595b26f4.pdf"></link>, so the approximations get closer to <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_beadc084773dc727b95854dcc1667b5893e6c095.pdf"></link> as the sequence goes on… really slowly. What if we only kept “good approximations”: the fractions with denominator <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_ab9c3c8c3b0d080190187f2c2a5f20ce04acacad.pdf"></link> that are within <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_b090c27129f2ebbf5c9ab011983c51365243bc24.pdf"></link> of <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_beadc084773dc727b95854dcc1667b5893e6c095.pdf"></link>?
<link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_52789f06ee2f0b7574776c460c53e35b690dcad1.pdf"></link>
This converges much faster. In theory, we could make the closeness criteria as strict as we want. <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_764e9f87229203c17f23b0cd43bbbd092a0600af.pdf"></link>? <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_e9337c36976e03cb7d09d4bcebac50ceb95ab9b0.pdf"></link>? As long as there are infinitely many of these “really good” approximations, we can form a sequence that converges to <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_beadc084773dc727b95854dcc1667b5893e6c095.pdf"></link>. However, this is impossibly rare. <span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_5e64510b5979c4326ac06b0670989041115b95d7.pdf"></link> can at best be approximated by an infinite sequence with a precision of <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_b090c27129f2ebbf5c9ab011983c51365243bc24.pdf"></link>.*</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Liouville numbers are those impossibly rare numbers. They are defined as all numbers which have infinitely many rational approximations within a margin of <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_f42d987c9f4591c88faf30df74f9f24463d2ed62.pdf"></link> — for any <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_ba46618ec0ffc257b9651066848682ffc61d2ba0.pdf"></link>. Even if I take <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_af487db8ced5fabe7a724bbf36ccbf876912e5be.pdf"></link>, I can find a fraction <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_dc60774a7de8d002ebacc1655d716ea64df80061.pdf"></link>, which is within <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_9763b58e308bf1dcb77f4eb28ad7990f806bbf06.pdf"></link> of Liouville’s constant. And then I can find another, and another, and another… infinitely many of them.</span>
Liouville proved the existence of his numbers by showing that for any integer <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_03512461ad7a24e6a75f8ec6431c72a43c363f16.pdf"></link>, the following is a Liouville number:

<h3>Floor 0.5</h3>
The sound of fluids rushing through pipes is a bit quieter now. You are a mere 10 steps up from the great pink 0, which you can still see. Next to you is a much more imposing pink 0.5. A scientist would grumble that this style is inconsistent, because it gives 1.5 more significant figures than 1. An artist would grumble that this style makes 0.5 looks more important than 0. A mathematician would grumble that symbolically, 0.5 is a construct of our arbitrary base 10 system. At least it looks cool.
To the left and right of the questionable pink number, are two plaques:
<link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_1903839d9021e180dd790c4cc63081c63b2fe6f1.pdf"></link>
<em><strong>Prime constant</strong></em>
<em><strong> 0.4146825098…</strong></em>
(For more digits, see OEIS A051006.) Depending on how many digits of the square root of two you know, you do a double take. Is that <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_e255b6b8d61cc7aacf0e8f1bac2092305813abc6.pdf"></link>? It isn’t, but you wouldn’t be wrong about the remarkable two-ness of this number. If you convert the prime constant to base 2, you get 0.01101010001010001010… (for more digits, see OEIS A010051). The prime constant is known to be irrational, but Wikipedia says (without citation) that nobody knows whether it is transcendental. (Perhaps you can find out?) <em>Exercise: why is it called the prime constant?</em>
<link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_da171ec557a765cb62022f1ac4c2cce4300f7bb8.pdf"></link>
<em><strong>Euler-Mascheroni constant</strong></em>
<em><strong> 0.5772156649…</strong></em>
(For more digits, see OEIS A001620.) Leonhard Euler was the first person known to identify the significance of <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_da171ec557a765cb62022f1ac4c2cce4300f7bb8.pdf"></link>, and needs no introduction. Lorenzo Mascheroni was born 43 years after Euler; he mastered Euler’s techniques and calculated <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_da171ec557a765cb62022f1ac4c2cce4300f7bb8.pdf"></link> correctly to 19 decimal places by hand!* We can distinguish <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_da171ec557a765cb62022f1ac4c2cce4300f7bb8.pdf"></link> from the other umpteen numbers named after Euler because it’s the only one that’s also named after Mascheroni.
* According to http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Mascheroni.html. Fumbling my way through the Latin manuscript by Mascheroni himself, I was only able to find 16 digits.
But what is <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_da171ec557a765cb62022f1ac4c2cce4300f7bb8.pdf"></link>? Everyone who hasn’t forgotten first-year calculus should be familiar with the pain of Riemann sums:
<link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_62c7e1947a4054c9d4cbf9bc7ee9c2fd74d5d57f.pdf"></link>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">But this is pretty nifty: if we don’t have a calculator, we can add up a bunch of simple reciprocals by hand to approximate <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_d12b6f9121e51fe5cbed8adbfe7676752b7613fc.pdf"></link>. The only problem is, we overshoot by a bit, because this is an upper</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Riemann sum. At <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_ecd244b6839b337265098cfb82618b61b5ee2595.pdf"></link>, the error is more than 0.5; at <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_dcec4380287bef26f5d89ac68b372509e2c9d7b2.pdf"></link>, the error is more than 0.57. Keep increasing <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_ba46618ec0ffc257b9651066848682ffc61d2ba0.pdf"></link> and eventually the error exceeds 0.577, then 0.5772, then 0.57721… and so you get the digits of the Euler-Mascheroni constant. (</span>This is not a good way to compute <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_da171ec557a765cb62022f1ac4c2cce4300f7bb8.pdf"></link>.)

In a nutshell, the Euler-Mascheroni constant is the error term of an ambitious crossover event between the discrete and continuous worlds of mathematics. Because of this, it pops up in all sorts of weird places. Perhaps the coolest example is Robin’s Theorem. If you find a number <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_a0f9950d98601075b3b88a5d99808ec3c33b4989.pdf"></link> whose positive divisors (including 1 and itself) sum to more than <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_197d9f0ffc6fe030be1a89cf38640c7b9cdffe0e.pdf"></link>, you will have refuted the Riemann hypothesis. If you prove that no such number exists, then you prove the Riemann hypothesis. <em>Exercise: prove or disprove the Riemann hypothesis.</em>
<h3>Floor 1</h3>
Climbing another 10 stairs, you return to civilization from the depths of the basement. A big pink 1 greets you with congratulations. This is where we leave off, but before you can exit, another plaque introduces itself.

<em><strong>Gauss’s constant</strong></em>
<em> <strong>0.8346268416…</strong></em>
(For more digits, see OEIS A014549.) Like Euler, Gauss needs no introduction. However, his constant likely does. Rooted in the depths of very hard integrals, Gauss’s constant is involved in a great number of seemingly unrelated problems under topics like:
<ul><li>the gamma function</li>
<li>the arc length of an <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_e050a7060d0c948bdd41661364b8af5fe63fd25d.pdf"></link>-shaped curve called the lemniscate of (Jakob) Bernoulli</li>
<li>definite integrals of <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_a7cfd28f5b287c28c6f02247ef5f74715add508b.pdf"></link> and <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_bec1da315a1c18a874331b86f5a1c9bb234bcc82.pdf"></link></li></ul>
In fact, the constant is named after Gauss because he proved that <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_8a7329cade99323c47c4e28a88efde832fdb9d44.pdf"></link> is the value of yet another very hard definite integral. Thus, with regard to undergraduate math, Gauss’s constant is probably the most esoteric one so far. Nonetheless, its definition is well within our grasp. <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_8a7329cade99323c47c4e28a88efde832fdb9d44.pdf"></link> is the reciprocal of the arithmetic-geometric mean of two simple numbers: 1 and <link href="file:///home/terry/Documents/Projects/prepress/tests/assets/pdf/Stairway_C_880c2d0b4fffd737508bcfc292c844ea62f78e96.pdf"></link>.

<content><strong>PICKERING</strong> — An emergency alert sent out to Ontario residents Sunday to correct a previous emergency alert transmitted in error about an incident at the Pickering Nuclear Generating Station was itself transmitted in error, according to the province.
In a statement released on Tuesday, Ontario Power Generation, the agency responsible for the operation of the station, announced that an extremely serious Keter-class incident had indeed occurred. The agency warned of the seriousness of the incident, noting that the effects could potentially “exceed those of Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, Fukushima Daiichi, and Pickering combined.”
An anonymous municipal official told us that the radiation levels in surrounding neighbourhoods are so high, police forces are attaching Geiger counters to their cruisers in lieu of sirens. Independent, verified sources from within the 10km exclusion zone have also sent in reports of plants quadrupling in size, talking frogs, and rocks spouting legs.
Trying to get a more detailed government response, we managed to stop Garg Rickover, provincial Minister of Energy, outside of his house for a quick interview.
“I’d make a comment on the state of affairs, but I really have to get my wife and kids in the car,” he said, profusely sweating inside of a hazmat suit while carrying a three-headed pigeon his cat had caught in the backyard.
When informed by our reporter of his appearance, the Minister immediately sprouted an extra eye and four extra mouths, before emitting a guttural howl and ohgodishecomingtowardushel —

<article><title>III. Lambdas? Oh, you mean functors?</title>
<content>Shut up. The C++ Police are close. I can hear them. The editors too. They’re going to string me up in the plaza and kill me. But first, I have one more secret I am to bestow unto you. Listen carefully. Okay:
Remember lambdas? How do they work? Why? Who cares? Me. I mean, those must’ve been pretty hard to implement, eh? Pretty radical, being able to just have a function be an object like that. I bet they went to some lengths to write that into GCC.
Wrong. Wrong; wrong; wrong. You know how lambdas act like objects, right? Well, I shouldn’t say they <em>act</em><em> like objects</em> — rather, they <em>are</em> objects. Okay, then an object needs a type. We’ve been glossing over this fact by just declaring our lambdas with <code>auto</code> all the time, but that seems rather obstructionist, hm? Let’s take a look.
<pre><code><mathnews--code-strong>int </mathnews--code-strong>main() {
<mathnews--code-strong>  int</mathnews--code-strong> x;
    auto fun = [=]() mutable -&gt; void {  // <mathnews--code-strong>Test</mathnews--code-strong><mathnews-pre--ruby>␣</mathnews-pre--ruby> <mathnews-pre--ruby>↪</mathnews-pre--ruby>line breaks that go on and on and on and on<mathnews-pre--ruby>␣</mathnews-pre--ruby> <mathnews-pre--ruby>↪</mathnews-pre--ruby>and on and on and on and on and on and on for<mathnews-pre--ruby>␣</mathnews-pre--ruby> <mathnews-pre--ruby>↪</mathnews-pre--ruby>it simply never stops.
    ++x;
    std::cout &lt;&lt; __func__ &lt;&lt; ": " &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt;<mathnews-pre--ruby>␣</mathnews-pre--ruby> <mathnews-pre--ruby>↪</mathnews-pre--ruby>std::endl;
  };
  fun(); fun(); fun();
}</code></pre>
Compile this code. What does it print?
<pre><code>operator(): 1
operator(): 2
operator(): 3</code></pre>
Oh, neat, the modified copy-capture of <code>x</code> gets preserved across invocations of the lambda. Also, hey, I thought that operator() was a member function given to classes to make them act like… oh… oh no. Computer, <em>enhance</em>.
<pre><code><mathnews-pre--lineno-start><mathnews--code-strong>int</mathnews--code-strong> main() {</mathnews-pre--lineno-start>
<mathnews-pre--lineno>  <mathnews--code-strong>int</mathnews--code-strong> x = 0;
  <mathnews--code-strong>auto</mathnews--code-strong> fun = [=]() <mathnews--code-em>mutable</mathnews--code-em> -&gt; <mathnews--code-strong>void</mathnews--code-strong> {
    ++x;
    std::cout &lt;&lt; <mathnews--code-u>__PRETTY_FUNCTION__</mathnews--code-u> &lt;&lt;<mathnews-pre--ruby>␣</mathnews-pre--ruby> <mathnews-pre--ruby>↪</mathnews-pre--ruby>std::endl;
  };
  fun(); fun(); fun();
}</mathnews-pre--lineno></code></pre>
Compile this code with GCC. Run it. Tell me what it prints.
<pre><code>main()::&lt;lambda()&gt; mutable: 1
main()::&lt;lambda()&gt; mutable: 2
main()::&lt;lambda()&gt; mutable: 3</code></pre>
Okay. So, you probably learned in a certain second-year CS course that classes in C++ can be fitted with an <code>operator()</code> method, which lets you “invoke” objects of the class as if the+y were a function. In an effort to sound like mathematicians, we call a class equipped with this method a <em>functor</em>. The nice thing about these so-called functors is that they <em>preserve state</em>. In particular, the data members of the class can be seen as state indicators to the function, so that information can be preserved across invocations. Here’s a cute little example:
<pre><code><mathnews-pre--lineno-start><mathnews--code-strong>struct</mathnews--code-strong> <mathnews--code-strong>Functor</mathnews--code-strong> {</mathnews-pre--lineno-start>
<mathnews-pre--lineno>  int x = 0;
  void operator()() {
    ++x;
    std::cout &lt;&lt; __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ &lt;&lt;<mathnews-pre--ruby>␣</mathnews-pre--ruby> <mathnews-pre--ruby>↪</mathnews-pre--ruby>std::endl;
  }
};
int main() {
  Functor fun;
  fun(); fun(); fun();
}</mathnews-pre--lineno></code></pre>
Here’s what gets printed:
<pre><code>void Functor::operator()(): 1
void Functor::operator()(): 2
void Functor::operator()(): 3</code></pre>
Mmm. So you see how it is now, yes? This example was not so cute, nor was it arbitrarily chosen. This looks strikingly similar to what we had before. That’s because, in fact, they’re the same.
When you create a lambda, what actually happens behind the scenes is that the compiler generates a unique functor class, defining its <code><mathnews--code-strong>operator</mathnews--code-strong>()</code> method by the body of the lambda. If <code>mutable</code> is not declared in the lambda, then the <code><mathnews--code-em>operator</mathnews--code-em>()</code> method of the functor is declared <code>const</code>. All captures in the lambda become member variables for the generated functor class; those captured by copy are made direct members by copy, and those captured by reference get reference members. The functor generated by the compiler is called a <em>closure type</em>, and we say that the result of a lambda expression is called a <em>closure</em>.
Nothing new here after all, eh? It’s all syntactic sugar. But at the end of the day, isn’t that all a programming language ever is?
Now run; leave. They’ll be prying the <code>type_traits</code> out of my cold, dead hands in no time.
